The white cheddar was great-I killed the small bag that day. On the other hand, the caramel- i really wasn't feeling it. I was scared that by eating it, I was going to chip my tooth or something. So i trashed that- right away. It's best to stick with the soft kind.  They had other favors but I didn't try it. All -in- all since it close to my house, I will most likely come here again.

The owner, Carlton, is very friendly and will let you try whatever kind of popcorn you want.  Now, it IS expensive.  I got a medium white chocolate peanut butter..but it is AMAZING!  I am a fan of the popcorn that has the softer kind of coating..like the cheese too.  Some of the coatings are more hard and stiff..like the caramel and cinnamon.  The cheese and caramel mix is very good as well.   I like the shop because it has a home town feel,  is in a great location (Durango and Flamingo by the Blockbuster video) and always has the door open..ready for customers.    I highly reccommend for a special treat!", "Date": "2011-02-23", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "D", "ReviewID": "568yO1u3LD4_t3tpY2bCsg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "I didn't know popcorn could be so delicious.

Popcorn girl is delicious and all, but this stuff is the SHIZNIT!   Everything here is fresh, the popcorn has great texture, and the flavor punch is 100%.   LOVE the cheese and white cheddar cheese. My friend Ame loves that the Jalepeno is actually spicy over Popcorn Girl's Southwest Jalepeno.   We sampled the caramel and cheese as well. The caramel has a thicker coating here and is much more flavorful. I know other reviewers said it was harder, but I do prefer this crunchier texture.   Also, the service here is amazing. One of the owners (the wife), although recovering from an accident and not in the most comforting state, greeted us and welcomed us warmly. She was genuinely proud of her store, and that made a huge difference for us.   It doesn't have the same old school candy store vibe as Popcorn Girl, but overall this place is the winner to me.", "Date": "2011-11-25", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Julie", "ReviewID": "y4NSD1qi_0K899F8C3xHXg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Outstanding!!!!!!

There's a little surprise at the end, so keep reading...  I met Carlton at Sunflower Market, buying the white chocolate he melts into his white chocolate and white chocolate/peanut butter popcorn. Oh yeah. As mouthwatering as it sounds. He invites me to his shop to check out his other flavors. I show up the next day and he literally has me try every flavor and I was blown away! I had Popcorn Girl a few months ago, and this is way better. I'm just sayin. You try it for yourself and see...  He has jalapeno. You can dial in the heat, depending on how spicy you like it. The Cheese/Carmel is SOOO good. By the way, he melts the cheese, too - no powder cheese here. Cinnamon? Yummmy. Then there's the combos - jalapeno/cheese. I even made one up - jalapeno/white chocolate. That was even good!    He gave me a tour of the kitchen, and it was immaculate. All the equipment was sparkling clean and tidy - and he showed me the ingredients that he uses.   Popcorn. That's what he sells - just amazing popcorn. No 10-sizes of football team tins, no candy, no flowers, no baskets. Just 17+ flavors of popcorn. There was nothing that wasn't great about the popcorn or the whole experience about being there. He obviously loves what he does.  The surprise? You're not going to get this anywhere else - get the Miguelito flavor. Pha-nomenal. I brought a bag into the movie theatre last night - all I could think was,  oh man, this is so amazing.   That place - its all about fun. If you like popcorn, go there. Just go.", "Date": "2010-09-16", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Michelle", "ReviewID": "HSDoHwVOef7PGNjN2YH-pg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Yum!  My friend and I happen to be driving by this place when she was craving caramel popcorn and didn't want to purchase them from the grocery store because of the preservatives in them.  When I yelled out that I saw the place, she flipped a U-turn and went straight there.  The popcorn is a little pricey, but its freshly popped every 12 hours and the taste is super worth it.  Be careful, their popcorn is addicting.   We ended up getting a large bag of caramel pecan.  It was so good.  The owner offered us samples of the cheddar and caramel mix which was actually good too!  The owner is super nice.  He opened up the store with his wife who really loves Chicago Style popcorn as they are originally from there.  We will definitely be back for more!", "Date": "2011-02-06", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "HyTClRVzdyfLU9v5Wzb5lw", "Overall": "4", "Content": "It seems that Dyers has recently closed.

But, I didn't want to be more of a fatty than I already am and get hooked and eat unnecessary amounts of popcorn. But, while with a friend, we decided we wanted to try it out. And let's just say that I will probably be eating a crap load of unnecessary amounts of popcorn. =\  It's a cute little shop, and they offer you samples if you don't know what you want. It seems to get pretty busy, but they do their best to expedite the process.   Not a big fan of the caramel/cheese combination that everyone seems to love. But my friend ended up mixing the caramel and jalapeño, which I absolutely loved. It sounds disgusting, and I judged her for getting it - but definitely changed my mind after trying. For myself, I got the white chocolate popcorn. I loved it, but it might be a bit too sweet for those who don't like sweet stuff.   I'll definitely be going back to try the rest of their flavors.", "Date": "2010-12-26", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Ian", "ReviewID": "FWyRFZNIeqpN4pDiVdWJGg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Every summer as a child I would vacation on the sandy shores of Ocean City, MD with my family.  We'd eat tons of crab, soak in the sun, and at night hit the Boardwalk for amusements and snacks.  Without fail on our first night we'd stop at Fisher's Popcorn for a tub of their sweet & buttery, hot & fresh caramel corn.  Our initial purchase usually carried us through the week, and before we left we'd get a refill (at a discount by returning with our tub,) so we could savor the flavor on the car ride home.  But this review isn't about Fisher's, it's about Dyer's in Las Vegas.  But how?!  My parents continue to vacation in Ocean City, and every summer they ship me a tub of Fisher's.  But this summer will be different, as I plan on turning down their generous annual gift and instead send them a bucket of Las Vegas' own - by way of Chicago - caramel corn from Dyer's Gourmet Popcorn.  Finally, a year-round fix dessert fix in the desert that captures all the popcorn goodness I fell in love with as a kid.  An unassuming strip mall storefront along West Flamingo, you can almost see co-owner Carlton's friendly, helpful, beaming smile from just driving by.  The inside is small and clean, with the the top-sellers on full display - Caramel Pecan Delight, Cheddar Cheese, and the  don't knock it 'til you try it  Cheddar/Caramel mix that first captivated the owners back in Chicago the way Fisher's wowed me.  Add in their selection of more exotic flavors - like Cinnamon and White Chocolate - and there's surely something for everyone on the menu.  Proudly, Carlton will tell you,  our popcorn is real popcorn, our caramel is real caramel, our cheese is real cheese;  no artificial mumbo-jumbo in sight, just the good stuff.  A few tips... they close at sunset on Friday's and re-open at sunset on Saturdays (for religious observance,) and are closed on Mondays.  Buy a refillable bucket for $3 and get over a gallon of popcorn at the reduced large price whenever you want, and trust me, you'll want it often.  It's definitely cheaper than a trip to Ocean City, MD!", "Date": "2010-04-14", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Elizabeth", "ReviewID": "jDNoH1y1Wch_FkKQdZNSXQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "The BEST popcorn in Las Vegas.
