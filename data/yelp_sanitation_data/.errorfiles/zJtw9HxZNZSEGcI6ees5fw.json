When my husband and i showed up we sat in the very front and center of the stage, it was dim, intimate, and island-ish. We sat with other people and that was fine, if you are an islander you know that its all about family so being seated with people was fine with us, we all spoke to one another and had a great time, we  then ordered our drinks and then our food. We got our drinks then they came out with the Bread it was very delicious it had white chocolate and macadamia bread (paloa bread), I ordered the macadamia crusted Mahi Mahi it came with jasmine rice and bok choy and was a very large portioned, my husband ordered the Ahi Tuna with the wasabi mashed potatos great portioned as well, before we got the main entrees we actually got a balsamic salad it had strawberries and pineapple, i am not a big fan of balsamic dressing so my husband had the salad, next time i will ask for a different dressing on the side (no biggie) then Jefferson Montoya came on stage he was a very funny and great singer! i absolutely LOVED him! he started up the crowd you can say, i could have listened to him all night, i wish he was on stage just a little longer( but the show must go on), Then he finished went towards the back of the stage and started playing the drums and singing, all of a sudden 3 very large handsome men came out and started dancing ( the LuWOW started!) there was one who caught my eye he was the tallest one, i mentioned it to my husband and he in a manly way agreed lol the guy was buff all over lol... the girls then came out and then the Lady singer and Elvis lol, it was a very high energy and had us all get up and dance as well! it was GREAT! i was bummed when the show ended, i had a BLAST and so did my husband! i will absolutely will be doing this again!

Even my kids (17, 16 & 13) were entertained & didn't roll their eyes! The dinner was delicious! Had the Mahi Mahi and the kids had the teriyaki steak. Yum! My only complaint is that their Vegan meal was stir-fried veggies and rice and they charged $20 (same as the 3 course meal) when the price on restaurant menu for the same veggie meal was $12.99. Show is $60 per person for 3 course dinner (drinks not included) and show or $40 for show only.

I received free tickets through my job so I decided, why not. The dinner portion wasn't included but I WAS going to add that onto our admission once we got there, because I knew it was only $25, or something like that, for a 3 course meal, and I looked at the menu online through their website and read about each course/entree and I was really impressed so I thought I'd give it a shot. But then I got on our beloved Yelp and decided to read some reviews before purchasing the dinner package, and I'm so glad I did. The pictures of the food definitely did not live up to the descriptions they had on their website; and by reading the reviews, the Yelpers seemed to think the same thing.  I did order drinks though. I ordered a cocktail for myself and one of their specialty drinks for my boyfriend. The bill for just 2 drinks was about $30 (one thing to keep in mind, gratuity is automatically added onto bill regardless of how many people are in your party).  As far as the show, I assumed that it was going to something along the lines of a luau, with Tahitian/hula dancers, cultural performances, etc. It was NOTHING like that lol. I think there were about 3 performances that had anything to do with Tahitian/hula. Other than that, majority of the performances were singing performances, an Elvis impersonator, and a guy that sang doo wop, r&b, and jazz songs (what that had to do with  Island Heat  I'll never know...)  Basically, its a VARIETY show. It wasn't horrible but it wasn't anything special either.

This is the main reason why this review is getting more than 2 stars.     Island Heat..  It's a mixture of glow sticks, fast luau dancing, with a mix a Tahitian style, and Samoan slap dancing.  Nothing like what island dancing would be like.  Thank goodness the girls were pretty.  Unfortunately, it was very underwhelming on a Saturday night, with only usually 2 ladies dancing throughout the night and 1 male Samoan chief doing his own thing on stage.    Then we have Elvis and Ms. Sheena both botox-out to meet the appearance of youth.  Elvis wasn't too bad, but when Sheena started with Gloria Estefan, it sort of throws this Island Heat dinner into identity crisis.    A for effort, but I wouldn't go back.  We got our tickets through Goldstar and only paid a $9 fee.  I can't imagine those poor folks that paid for full entrance fee along with a up-charge of $20+ for dinner.

You have the option of ordering food which was 20 bucks per person. Originally I was just gonna watch the show but since I have never stepped foot in this place called Kahunaville located inside the Treasure Island Hotel and Casino, I was curious about the food they served here. So I gave in and decided to share a meal with my wifey.   If you refer to the picture of the menu I took, your meal starts off with Bread (macadamia white chocolate roll), Salad (mixed greens, provolone, pineapple, strawberries, mandarin oranges, tomatoes and pecans tossed in a balsamic vinaigrette topped with fresh shaved toasted coconut. Then you select a main entree. We chose the Ahi Tuna (pan seared yellow fin tuna served rare with wasabi mashed potatoes, baby bok choy, and a ginger soy reduction. Lastly you you get dessert (we got a white chocolate covered cake pop). Drinks are extra.  The bread was basically a Hawaiian sweet roll with raisins. It seemed a bit dry. Based on the description of the salad you would think that they would give you a big bowl of it. Turns out that they only bit a tiny amount of each mentioned so when you actually dig into it, there really isnt much substance to it. I finished it pretty quick. The main entree was very good. The fish was encrusted with ground pepper and sliced into 6 thin pieces. It was very tasty but seemed more like an appetizer. Lastly, the cake pop for dessert was equivalent to two bites. The white chocolate gave it good flavor.  Service was weird. The first thing that threw me off was that they had you share a table with complete strangers. Our table mates, although they were nice, seemed irritated that the Teriyaki Steaks that they ordered were both well done even though they wanted both to be medium rare. Our server was assigned several tables and at times was nowhere to be found. The few times that she did show up, it seemed like she was in a hurry to get our plates out of the way even though we were not done eating yet. The worst part was that it took forever to get the check and by the time I got the receipt to sign, half the people in the room were already gone. Plus on top of that, a gratuity of 20 percent was already added to our total even though I was the only one that ordered. I didnt think she deserved much of a tip let alone 20 percent.  As for the show, it was mediocre at best. Starts out with some dude playing the guitar singing a couple of Hawaiian songs while firing off one liners at the audience to see if anybody was actually paying attention. Then comes an Elvis impersonator singing yup, you guess it, more Hawaiian songs. I have seen plenty of Elvis impersonators in my lifetime. This guy was not all that good. Eventually a couple of guys and 3 girls come out to start their  Luau  dancing while another lady comes out as the lead singer does her thing. This is what alternated pretty much for the 1 hour and 15 minute duration of the show.  In the end, everything put together did not impress me much. The entertainment was 3 stars. The food and service that went along with it was 1 star. One good thing to note is that their drummer/music dj is the father of Bruno Mars! If anything that is something worth mentioning. So if you are planning on watching this show, I recommend you eat somewhere else and just try to enjoy the show itself. Its not too bad but at the same time I have seen better. Come early to get good seats for its general admission.

That being said, I've seen this show five times now and that should say quite a bit in itself.   I was not expecting much since it is a dinner-show but I am always blown away by the authenticity of the ambiance, food and performers. Any tourist posting less than a glowing review needs to realize; it's an hour-long dinner show for 39.95, not a 3 hour Celine Dion concert at Caesars Palace for 300 bucks a ticket. The value of a ticket to Island Heat is well worth your money!   The price includes a 3 course meal! They begin with a flavorful, fruity, Hawaiin salad; then comes your choice of entree. The Ahi Tuna melts in your mouth alongside wasabi mashed potatoes. And don't get me started on the cheesecake! You're enjoying this food while being entertained by incredible (easy-on-the-eyes) dancers and the musical stylings of well-known Vegas entertainers, Sina Foley & James Lowrey. All around you are tiki torches, bamboo and incredible lighting. They spared no expense assuring your experience is authentic as possible, like you're transported to a Polynesian island.   The best part of this show is that it is never the same. As I said before, I've been five times and each time there has been a new number added or new genre of music they'll feature. During my most recent visit, I was delighted to see they incorporated doo wop and fantastic harmonies! You'll be serenaded by the best Elvis voice in town through James and the stunning Sina will definitely keep you drooling long after the cheesecake is gone. And for the gals, the male dancers made me quite insecure about my physique if you catch my meaning.   Bruno Mars was in the audience this past Saturday night watching his father, Peter Hernandez, who is the musical director and percussionist for the Island Heat experience. Take it from a Vegas local and performer: The Island Heat experience has my vote for Las Vegas' best bang for your buck!", "Date": "2015-08-25", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "David", "ReviewID": "TlS-l85NWLirflI5U8fFLg", "Overall": "2", "Content": "I was offered two free tickets to see the Island Heat show.  I have never hear of this place.  I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into, so I went to the main website to do some research. It describe the show as:  combining the excitement of Polynesian dance with a Las Vegas twist .  Ohhhhhh sounds interesting, I'll give it a try... I don't have anything planned tonight anyways.  When I went to pick up my tickets for the show, we were asked if we wanted to include dinner with our show for $20.  The dinner provided was a three course meals, starting with Lua'ai (salad) and Paola (Macadamia White Chocolate Roll), your choice of one entree (Macadamia Crusted Mahi Mahi, Teriyaki Flank Steak, Ahi Tuna, Pina Colada Chicken), and a dessert.  It sounded delicious, so we decided to include dinner with our show.  Food: Our first course was the Lua'ai salad with Paola bread.  The Lua'ai included some greens, strawberry, pineapple, and mozzarella cheese. According to the menu, the Paola was supposed to be Macadamia white chocolate roll, but instead we were given a bread roll with bits of cranberry jam inside.  I guess they ran out?  Anyways, nothing stood out with either dishes.  I ordered the Macadamia Crusted Mahi Mahi.  It included a decent size Mahi Mahi with a side of rice and bok choy.  According to the menu, it was suppose to include a mango salad, but it was not on my dish.  Also, the rice was dry and was harden.  The entree was also okay, nothing stood out.  My boyfriend ordered the Teriyaki Flank Steak.  It was cooked perfectly for his taste (medium well) and I definitely enjoyed it better than my Mahi Mahi.  As for the dessert, we were each given a small piece of cheesecake, nothing stood out with it as well.  Service: With first impression, the staff was friendly.  As the night went on, my impression of the staff changed.  It started off with the drinks.  My boyfriend ordered a glass of coke.  We noticed that everyone else was getting their drinks and some people were getting their food already and yet he still haven't received the coke he ordered.  When my boyfriend ask for a refill, our server said sure, but never brought over another glass.  These things of thing isn't a big deal, but what is a big deal for me is that they OVERCHARGED ME!  The dinner itself is $20 per person, plus a glass of coke, plus tax, our total should have been about $47, but instead it came out to almost $60 for the entire night! Apparently, they charged me 20% in taxes for the meal... unbelievable.  On top of that, they do not give you the option of allowing you to put in your own gratuity, they do it for you.  Show: The show was okay.  I was expecting a show full of different element of Polynesian dancing, but instead, it was more of a variety show.  It started out with Polynesian dancing, then it went into a segment with an Elvis impersonator, then into a segment of motown/doo-wop music.  I enjoyed the dancing and the singing was pretty good especially with the female singer, but still, I was expecting more Hawaiian elements.  When I saw the show, a group called  Island Heat  were performing at Kahunaville just for a few months.  So perhaps, their regular shows maybe completely different.  They also played the Lilo & Stitch which was awesome!  Overall: At first I was going to give this place a rating of 3 stars, but after looking at the menu while I was writing this review, I noticed that some of the items that was suppose to be on my plate wasn't and our servers never bothered to let us know about it.  Also, I didn't notice the 20% in taxes that they charged me until I was writing this review.  The show itself was okay.  It definitely isn't worth what they charge for it, which is $39.99.

Got free tickets to see the show. Eating dinner is extra but only $20 more so that's not too bad. It's supposed to start at 8 but you aren't allowed in until about 815 with the actual show starting probably closer to 840. Most likely due to wanting to get out all the entrees before the show starts.   The food isn't worth it. The best thing you get is a salad. For its small size, it's delicious. But then again, it's drenched in balsamic vinegar and has cheese on it so not surprising. The sweet roll was fine, a bit dry. The main course, there are four options. We decided to go with macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi, trying to get the most Hawaiian dish possible. This ended up being a mistake. The fish wasn't very warm, it was over cooked and soggy. Defeated the purpose of having a macadamia nut crust. Rice was bland bland bland. Dessert was cheesecake which was okay. Not worth $20.   Now disclaimer: I've seen a luau in Hawaii and this is not that. It is the skeleton of what a luau would be but it's lacking a ton.   For one, there's no story or through line for this show. Things just happen. They dance, then they play a song, then a horrible woman comes out and sings, then there's another dance but with glow sticks , then Elvis comes out, then he leaves and more glow sticks happen. I wanted to know a little something about why any of this was happening.   They don't prime the audience for the show at all. The show just starts out of nowhere. Then they look upset when people aren't applauding. Well hello, you can't just go straight into the show like that. Our entree plates just got set on the table and they had turned off the lights and started the show.   The two male dancers were first. There was one with longer hair out into a but of a bun, he looked lost throughout the first half of the show. He seemed so concentrated on what move comes next that his face looked pain. No fun in what he was doing. This plagued most of the dancing bits.   The best thing about the show was the Elvis impersonator. He doesn't necessarily look like an identical twin to Elvis but he did belt a tune. Also he was having fun on stage, his dance moves and facial expressions did have me rolling. He did bring his wife on stage for a duet which he really didn't need to do but he was awesome.   Papa Mars was pretty awesome on percussion and Kai did a fine job as all around utility man (playing ukulele, singing backup). Near the end of the show it seemed like the cast was having a better time but took too long. Show isn't very long. We were out by 930.  One positive: got to take a picture with papa Bruno Mara.   Other than the Elvis impersonator and papa Mars, this show wasn't worth it. A few quick things could help the show (dancers having fun, a bit more story and explanation, lowering the volume) immensely but I'm afraid those things won't happen.", "Date": "2015-07-25", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Marco", "ReviewID": "HsgcwUxDdqHJ_2ZIjFLHrQ", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Only watched the show and used a coupon for bogo on a drink.

A couple parties just flat out got up and left, now I feel you should at least stick it out to the end, because we did get to see one old man get up and awkwardly dance behind his wife for the last song, which may have been the funniest part of the evening.

I have no idea on the food as we did not dine, I'm only addressing the show.  First of all, start time was supposedly 8pm but they didn't open the doors until several minutes past this point and the show itself didn't start until 8:55pm--a longer wait than the actual show.  (The website says 70 minutes--it wasn't.)  They had a cast of 8--one guy on a stringed instrument (who sang a bit), one guy on percussion, one Elvis-style singer (I find  impersonator  too strong a word), one female singer with an obvious and not very good boob job, two male  dancers  and two female dancers, one of which is nowhere near the expected looks of even a B-list Vegas showgirl.  I put the male  dancers  in quotes because they do far more jumping and thumping than anything I would remotely call dancing.  The women are actually doing Polynesian dancing--lots of hand gestures, lots of booty-shaking, nothing remotely acrobatic.  The dancers are off-stage far longer than would be needed for costume changes, there is no set to change, no props beyond what people have in their hands.  Attire for the men is generally fabric hanging down in front and back or something roughly approximating a grass skirt (the primary covering being a bunch of pieces hanging down), attire for the women is generally a fancy but pretty well-covering top piece, normally a bare belly and usually something in the grass-skirt genre down below.  The men sometimes had sticks, sometimes spinning them, the women sometimes had more flexible things to spin.  No hula-hoops.  The music was **way** to loud--I could understand that if the audience were 20-somethings but few there looked to be less than 40.  By Vegas standards this had the heat of an ice cube.", "Date": "2015-07-17", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Misty", "ReviewID": "EPMEOas3hAJgpkofNO_vLg", "Overall": "2", "Content": "This show seems to have a little bit of an identity crisis.   The show was lacking in energy and did not seem to have a narrative or a point. It just seemed like they did not want to be there sometimes.  Like why is there a Gloria Estefan song? And then an Elvis song? And then a glow stick dance. Also, the description for the show says to the beats of the Black-Eyed Peas...and that part was missing. Just why was any of it happening to as part of a  Luau- WOW . But also called Island Heat, so are they referring to Cuba as an island, hence the Gloria Estefan song? I am just making this assumption because there is really no other indication for it. Maybe the hostess lady said something about it but the sounds is really loud and she did not enunciate very well so I may have missed something.   I also understand that they cannot use real fire in the show, but they use glow sticks instead during certain parts. But maybe they could explain that? And then maybe add some reasons why it is important for certain cultures to incorporate fire into their ritualistic dance. Just a suggestion because honestly this show just seemed like a string of dances and musical numbers with no real tie-in. Kind of like a talent show.   The dinner was very meh. I liked the beginning salad and I opted for the mahi mahi. Yikes, it was bland and over-cooked. It came with a side of bland rice and over-steamed baby bok choy. There was a little pile of mango salsa that I parceled out to try and make it tastier.   Overall, I would not recommend the show at this point.

After standing in line for forty minutes with tickets, at last it was time to enter the showroom.  Bread served here was unique but good.  And, except for a piece of included Iceberg Lettuce core, a garden salad and bowl of Tortilla Soup with chicken, tomato, celery, and Tortilla Strips were both very good.  So were thin French Fries, except they were served warm rather than hot.  I imagine that it is a difficult task of timing for chefs and servers to simultaneously serve a whole audience of hungry diners preliminary and main courses before the lights are dimmed for the lively show.    My main consisted of a nicely sized portion of very fine lean Teriyaki-Ginger-marinated Flank Steak accompanied by Bok Choy and good Jasmine Steamed Rice.  When the lights dimmed I just had a few bites in my steak remaining to be consumed, and downed them quickly.  After I polished off the Flank Steak, an excellent yummy slice of Cheesecake was brought forward during the show to complete a fine meal.  Seating was comfortable, with good sight lines of the stage for most diners.  The show itself was nicely varied, with easy on the eyes hula and Tahitian wahine dancers and energetic male dancers, songbird-quality singers, and adept professional musicians on sax, guitar, and percussion.   Service was friendly and efficient, and we were allowed to order a mixture of offerings from the full restaurant menu as well as the more limited show menu.  My only gripe is that an 18% gratuity was automatically added to the check for my  Large [?] Party  of four!", "Date": "2015-12-18", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Stephen", "ReviewID": "V_aLxDYkUna_He4m8KGzLQ", "Overall": "2", "Content": "Food was acceptable but dollar for dollar there is better at Treasure Island.  Thankful the hotel did not charge for the show and would be very disappointed had we paid for it.  If you can get the show for free and are looking to take the family then it's probably okay but would definitely not go out of your way for it.", "Date": "2015-12-12", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Karny", "ReviewID": "vQGMtEY_NVTuUBwkXNCAPw", "Overall": "2", "Content": "Honestly, this was kind of a waste of money. With the quality of shows around the strip, this didn't hold a candle. We purchased tickets online and the teenage girl at the desk had no idea what she was doing when we showed up with our printed confirmation. The  owner of the show  ended up just looking at our confirmation and initialing it and saying  show this to your waitress.  It was open seating and we got a booth in the back. The food was DECENT but the drinks were weak. The show was CHEESY and the dancers were out of sync. And there was a really young, cheesy elvis impersonator. We ended up leaving early. If you want a true Las Vegas dinner show experience, go to Tournament of Kings, you won't be disappointed.  And yeah Bruno Mars dad plays drums in the show but it still ain't shit.", "Date": "2015-05-08", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Angel", "ReviewID": "IOPxb9VN31g54-Nly4r40A", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Now this is a show that was definitely worth watching and the optional dinner was even better because I started building an appetite in the middle of the show while the menu that Kahunaville restaurant offered is exceptional! So I had to order.  First they made the access to the show and buying my tickets a breeze! I went to their website which you can easily just Google their name at  Island Heat Show  and check out their showtimes as well as buy their tickets. Really nice evening and my date had a great time and loved it. This show made my dinner date look like a WINNER!   The service was great as well. Their restaurant manager walked around the tables prior to the show starting and introduced himself and asked us if there was anything else we needed. Service is everything in a city like Vegas and they topped my list of venues to visit - either for the show or their restaurant bar next door outside the showroom.  The performers where incredible! the Elvis impersonator and the lead singer were really good entertainers who know how to get the crowd engaged and in great spirits. The dancers provided an exciting and entertaining performance, especially when they enveloped the crowd in one of their acts. I thought that was great - with all the shows in Las Vegas now a days that basically look like a movie theater instead of an engaging performance - other shows tend to just have rows of seats and a stage nothing else, everything far away and no basic interaction. This was different and that was welcoming!  Their food!!! Although it is optional you really can't have the full show without a good meal. Go their hungry. I thought their pineapple chicken was delicious! They started me off with a nice light salad and when the main course came out my jaw dropped!   I recommend this show to anyone. Sometimes Cirque style shows can get old when they have one in every casino. Island Heat Show provides variety.", "Date": "2015-01-30", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
