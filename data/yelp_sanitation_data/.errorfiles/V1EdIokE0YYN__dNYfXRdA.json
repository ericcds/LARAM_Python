Its tastes fresh and is very filling, but doesnt give you the itis. I went with a medium bowl the first time, but wasnt enough fish for my liking so I have gone with a large the past 2 times.  This is what I get and its delicious and satisfying every time.  White rice if you want it to be warm, sushi rice if you dont like the idea of eating slightly warm raw fish. I found both to be tasty still, but whatever floats your boat. Warm raw fish can be a mindfuck and off putting though, so recommend you eat it there if you go with it.  Protein: I always get the hawaiian poke as well as the salmon and hamachi with just a splash of the original sauce on them.  Toppings: seaweed salad, crab salad, red onion, masago, pickled cucumbers, and crispy garlic(makes a huge difference in flavor and texture).  I destroy the entire bowl.. every.single.time.  Service and portion consistency could use some work. I think if you go closer to closing they hook you up with more fish since theyre probably going to toss the leftovers anyways.

All bowls come with seaweed salad and the crab.  For the toppings, I chose the mixed green salad, pickled cucumber, fresh cucumber, furikake, fried garlic and fried onion.

Sushi burrito concoction has become a big thing and I am definitely a fan.  Concept is very simple here. You can either get a burrito which is a set menu, or you can get a bowl and customize your way. I decided to get #2 called Pokeman burrito and also got a large bowl to go.   Large bowl comes with three scoops of rice, along with three choices of protein, a choice of sauce and veggies. It's somewhat similar to Subway in that ingredients used are fresh. On top of that, you can customize it the way you like it! I went with yellowtail, salmon and ahi tuna with pokeman original sauce and furikake. I loved the fact that they mixed all the protein with sauce in a plastic bowl and marinated the fish to maximize the flavor. My bowl was delicious and filling.   Pokeman burrito was savory and delicious too. I forgot to note what was inside the burrito but I liked the fish to rice ratio.

The prices are standard but the toppings (masago, etc.) are extra which is confusing to me because I've never seen that at any other poke place. Aside from the extra $ for toppings, the portions are honestly pathetic. The scoops they give you are so small I basically paid for a bowl of rice. I usually have my plate overflowing when I get poke. Not only that, but the spicy tuna looked like pumpkin pie filling? No thanks. Honestly, save your money and time, and get your sushi burritos from JaBurrito (or whatever they're named now) and get your poke from Island Sushi & Grill. Best poke in town.

My Yelp Challenge 2016. I'm excited to try a new place since I'm obsessed with Poke bowls and my usual is Soho Sushi Burrito.   First impression, price is just a couple dollars steeper than Soho. I got the  large  which gives you three scoops of protein. Only thing is, their scoops are pretty pathetic. A scoop of their bay scallop literally four pieces of little baby scallops. I can't imagine getting a small bowl. You'll literally have 3 small squares of fish.  Although, seaweed salad and the imitation crab mix here is a standard inclusion in their bowl. It's extra for those items at Soho. They also have little toppings like Furakake, Crispy Garlic, Dry Seaweed Flakes, etc that you can add to customize your bowl. I would say that their  large  is equivalent to Soho's 2 protein, BUT Pokeman's free scoop of crab makes up for it. I got the salmon, and octopus & scallops (soho does not carry octopus and scallops) with the Yuzu Aoili.   First bite, mmmmm.. the Yuzu Aoili is flavorful, but not too much where its overpowering the taste of the fish. Pretty yummy, citrusy, creamy taste. Fish is pretty fresh tasting. The bad? OH NO. There was a deng bone in my salmon. lol, thank God I didn't choke on it 'coz I'm literally inhaling this food as I go.  Overall, its pretty good here.

I also ordered #3 called  Maui  and it used  Pineapple Wasabi sauce , which was interesting and attractive to me. On my goodness, you must try the sauce!! It tasted amazingly as it was my first time to taste such sauce and you never know unless you try and taste it.

I was in the area of Pokeman last night which is where I was originally directed when I was told about Sushi Burritos and finally decided to give it a go. I was EXTREMELY impressed. The service was awesome, and the sushi burrito was even better.   They don't allow you to just choose whatever you want to put on the burrito, they have a pretty set selection of about 15 for you to choose from. So unlike the other spot I went to, I didn't have the endless options. I ended up going with a #1 and the employee said if I like spicy, I should probably change it to a #2 since it was basically a #1 with the addition of jalapenos- so I did. I got the spiciest sauce they offered and it was HOT! (which I loved)  It was about $3.50 more than I typically pay at Soho but quite honestly, I had no problem paying the $12 for what I got because it was filling and very delicious.

The staff is very friendly and helpful. Don't be afraid to ask questions or help!   Food 5/5: Each sushi burrito has its own ingredients that makes each of them unique. I have tried their signature sushi burrito called Pokeman, their Eel Lover roll, and their Island Crunch. They are all really delicious but my favorite would have to be the Island Crunch (without the ginger). I also love the fact that you are able to replace or take out ingredients that you are not very fond of. For the Island Crunch, for example, I alternate between keeping the shrimp tempura that originally comes with it or replacing it with Yellow tail marinated in their Pokeman sauce. Their bowls are basically the sushi burrito without the nori. You can customize what goes in the bowl with their easy steps to your hearts' content. Their bowls are also pretty good but I prefer the burritos more. I would definitely would have to come back more adventurous and try different burritos in the future! They are all so delicious!

The location is prime and placed adjacent to Izakaya Go the restaurant owners other establishment. So i would recommend stopping at Pokeman for some grub and then heading over the short walk to Izakaya Go for some drinks!   Anyways, on to the most important part-the food. The greatest part about this whole place is that the bowls are so customizable! I got a medium Poke bowl with Yellow tail and Ahi tuna as the protein. Now before we go any further we must discuss the sauce! Instead of just squeezing whatever sauce you decide to choose over the whole bowl, they do the super clever thing of tossing it to coat the protien-and then adding it all into your bowl. So don't you worry about getting an unflavored bite-because that will not happen.  Accompanied by seaweed salad, corn, green onions, avocado and the standard addition of surimi crab salad. To top off this masterpiece I had it sprinkled generously with Furikake (I have an unhealthy addiction to furikake btw).  S'goooooood! All ingredients were fresh and tasty, plus the staff was knowledgeable and friendly which is always a plus.

I drop my parents off at Pokeman while I waited at Halal Guys to pick up a few items.   Then I finally arrived at Pokeman and decided to BYO Poke Bowl. I was pleased with the outcome of my bowl that I forgot to take a picture. However the fish was delicious and fresh and the variety of toppings were great. I really enjoyed the Miso Seasame Sauce for my bowl, a bit of a creamy and sweet taste with a tangy flavor, it was good with the Yellowtail and Salmon mix that I got. It's amazing to see Poke concept explode throughout Vegas. It takes me back when I used to live in Hawaii everytime I have Poke!   The staff on duty was very friendly and helpful especially when it came time to decide what items that we wanted.

They have a variety of burritos for different palettes. The protein they have available is inclusive to vegetarians, those who dont like raw fish, and those who dont like any fish in general. You can order a sushi burrito or a poke bowl. Everything is fresh, the decor is cute, and everybody is inviting.  The burrito menu are a fixed combination of ingredients, with different types to make anybody's taste buds sing. My personal favorite is the Eel Lover! Its their most expensive burrito at nearly $12 but it's eel and thats a pricy fish to get for any restaurant. Also available at PokéMan, they have customizable bowls. Small, medium, and large are the sizes. One scoop of protein for the small, two for medium, and three for the large. You choose your protein and then a sauce to mix in or drizzle over the meat. You then get many vegetable items to choose too accompany your meat and rice/salad. To top it ALL off, they have shaken toppings of your choice as well. For drinks, they have canned and fountain ranging from $1.50 to about $2.00.  The atmosphere, i say, is very laid back. They have many places to sit and eat your poke. Orange and white for the interior is a refreshing sight. Wide windows are on the building for nice natural lighting, but have blinds to keep the sun out if it gets too hot. This restaurant keeps super clean tables and bathrooms for us to use. I notice that the employees there keep it clean on their work surface and their gloves are changed so often. They are welcoming in the beginning and definitely are helpful with the menu. Knowledgeable and fast too! They try their best helping guests with whatever questions we have while also taking care of your order.  Another restaurant hopping on to the sushi burrito bandwagon, and PokéMan fits in perfectly.

News flash, if you don't give your customers what they want they will not be happy, very likely to not come back, and share with their friends.   Everyone MUST know I really enjoy this place... The quality, service (minus below), and cleanliness. So what has ticked me? :-) Next paragraph!  It was 3pm and I had yet to have lunch, I have after school pick up for my son and thought it'd be great to bring my son a mini spam burrito. Just spam and rice wrapped in seaweed very much like a spam musubi. They have a burrito with spam but action packed with all sorts of other yummies wrapped inside of it... The price is a little under $8. Well if you know the cost of spam, rice, and seaweed well HELL NO!! I will not pay $8 + tax for it. I asked who seems to be a partner/owner or manager if that price can be revisited as I'm looking for something much simpler and for a child. I feel most of the businesses offer kids menus with lowered prices etc... Well I was very disappointed with the answer of... NO with the reason being that they had already preset the price. So at the risk of losing a customer (me) who comes a few times a month with friends who now also come... Well you get the idea the reasoning makes zero sense to me. By no means am I asking for something free, nor deal hunting but what's right... Spam, rice, and seaweed should not cost $8+. At that point Hawaiian Style Poke, WINS-best of both!

I'll come back for the the build your own bowl option, they're the only spot in town to figure out that you're supposed to marinate the fish before putting it in the bowl rather than just drizzling it on top.

Next time I go I might try a bowl, those looked just as great.", "Date": "2016-10-27", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Madison", "ReviewID": "paOzsEdflg73mwf0nKQOTw", "Overall": "4", "Content": "This is the first time I went to a Poke place. It's very convenient and customizable which is something that appeals to everyone. They had a big variety of toppings and fish to choose from. I also liked the pokemon theme they had going on. (Side note: On Pokemon Go, if your team is the same team as the gym there, you get a discount)   This place is new and clean which I like, but they need to up their portions. I don't know if I can justify paying $10 for a small bowl which I can probably make at home for less than half the cost but it was very yummy.   Their menu isn't just custom bowls, but also sushi burritos! They have a preset menu with some popular pairings. I guess now, I have to stop by Soho sushi burrito to compare the two.", "Date": "2016-07-29", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Ron", "ReviewID": "RCtzOj3ZEHSrmZoAgHGb8Q", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Staff was still in training when I visited, so I won't review that. What I liked most about this new sushi burrito joint is that when you ask for a sauce to go with your fish, they mix it before adding it to the bowl or burrito.  The poke cubes are regular poke-sized. If you've been to Soho SushiBurrito, you may recall that their fish is diced small. Here at PokeMan, you can get chunks of fish with every bite.  I like the bright, orange interior. It makes me feel refreshed and happy! They recently adjusted the height of the glass guard in front of the food so they can hear you better. Overall, this one seems to be quite promising as a new sushiburrito spot.", "Date": "2016-07-03", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Allen", "ReviewID": "_yLgQYzLUyd2FzUT_rOkJg", "Overall": "4", "Content": "This place is located on the corner of Spring Mountain & Valley View. It is right next to the Starbucks drive-thru window. There are only a few parking spots in front of the store, so you may have to park somewhere else in the plaza. Not a big deal. The store is pretty small. It only has a few tables and a small counter on the back wall with some stools. It may be difficult to find a seat when it gets busy. All of the food is prepared in front of you where you order and pay. The food prep area appeared to be very clean, as did the dining area.  I ordered the #13 vegan roll. It was made with tofu, veggies, rice, and a sesame ginger sauce. It was very good. I definitely recommend that you stop in and try Poke Man. I will be back.", "Date": "2016-07-21", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
