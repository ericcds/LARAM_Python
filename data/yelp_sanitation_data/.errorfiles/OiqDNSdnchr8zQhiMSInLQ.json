It's just the concept of paying for a meal where the star attraction is the noodles and the dipping sauce it comes in just isn't that appealing. I'm used to a bowl of noodles where the broth is the highlight of the dish or the ingredients are and the noodles just complement as well as add some filling in the bowl.  Being this was my first time at I-Naba i opted to try the evening's tasting menu which was a 4 course dinner for 18. Portions were small which reflects traditional Japanese style. I didn't remember to take a picture of the tasting menu. With that in mind i'm going to describe what came out without knowing their proper names or the other option available.  1st course - braised mackrel  Served cold which was a surprise to me but still pretty good. The sauce they braised in it was light and refreshing and paired quite nicely with the mackrel   2nd course - deep fried shrimp with a hunk of fish cake attached to it served with fried tofu and eggplant in sauce The fish cake is very Japanese which is the only way i can describe it. Flavored with herbs and heavy with course cuts of vegetables. not exactly what i was expecting with it comes to fish cake but it was still nice.   3rd course - Bowl of udon soup with slices of rib eye Even though this place is known for it's soba noodles the udon is excellent. The broth was light and refreshing as well as complemented the udon noodles quite well.  4th course - shaved watermelon ice with sesame ice cream The sesame ice cream had honey drizzled over it and was a small scoop but packed a very rich and pleasant sesame taste. They did an excellent job shaving the watermelon ice as it wasn't prone to melting quickly and had a rich watermelon taste.  Not exactly what i was expecting at all when i came here but will gladly return.", "Date": "2012-10-30", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Shelly", "ReviewID": "iTtkZgpxq11ZWwCikv4JGQ", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Can they please hire an extra server?

That's why I made the trek to I Naba for the special zaru soba.  Verdict?  It was OK...  The best part of the Zaru Soba was probably the noodles which were thin and chewy.  Otherwise, I wasn't impressed with the broth which I thought was not enough flavor and a tad bit salty.  Also, the portion was TINY!!  They really should have an option for a larger size.  I also ordered the Saba Nanban Zuke.  Dislike! First, it's fried but served chilled which I definitely wasn't expecting.   The skin is still on (which I prefer not to eat) so it was diffcult separating the meat from the skin, especially using chopsticks.   It was also tossed with some sliced veggies and a yuzu-type marinade. Sorry but I didn't find much to like about this dish.  At the end of the meal, they bring you a little pot filled with broth that was used to cook the soba and it's supposed to be mixed with the your leftover broth.

I never been here so was really looking forward too my first time. I was not disappointed at all. The hospitality the owners showed doing tasting menu for big group was class act (they even willing too do all separate checks for us). Showed me lot about there passion for their food!  We started with tempura style salmon pieces believe not even part of the tasting menu. The first course was sashimi platter was AMAZING! By far my favorite course of the menu. Not only was the presentation elegant and modern but it tasted as great as it looked. The Umi, too spicy yellow tail tartar, traditional cuts of salmon, yellowtail, and tuna, the quail egg (unfortunately only one), and every flavor and texture on one plate. Second course Tempura course. We have lot of different things but most enjoyed was the tempura batter. I know every restaurant the batter consistency will vary but this one was beautiful. It was nice light, everything perfectly perfect coating, not greasy at all, and on point. Third course was grilled Black Cod with clams. The Black Cod was seared perfection with nice crust and the sauce combine with the clams over the top in butter sauce was divine. Fourth course Shabu Shabu. The broth was out of control GOOD. By the end after all the fresh seafood, and vegetables broth was sooo Ono. Last thing thing added was the Udon noodles out of control. The presentation with the ceramic looking base for the pot was very nice touch! Fifth course was the dessert! Even at the end everything was amazing! Two different kinds one owe crepe with green tea ice cream and some kind of sauce on top. Other one really enjoy more was red bean on bottom, think coffee ice cream on top, fresh cuts of fruit on top, and sauce over the top. It almost looked like fruit cup but at whole another level. Everything was tasty, presentations were top notch, and barely touching the menu.

There is only one server but she did a good job being attentive to us despite having 75% tables full. I must say, before writing this review I came across a few recent reviews of yelpers being very critical of the service...it's unfortunate some yelpers feel entitled to bash a hard working server without first knowing their circumstances or give one star claiming the owner should hire additional server (despite admitting food is good) without first understanding the challenges small business owners face to stay afloat.

The broth was savory! You can add wasabi/green onions to your sauce.  With that order, it came with soy sauce seasoned rice, which was okay to me.. Not a fan of the rice. But the shrimp and vegetable tempura were really good! Probably one of the best tempuras I've ever had. It was so fresh, the batter wasn't overdone or floury. Also, it came with a side of curry flavored salt and green tea flavored salt for your tempura.. that was a first, I really liked it!  The meal was really good.

While Ichiza might offer a crowded and loud experience out of the corner of Tokyo, I-Naba would be a gentle breath of Kyoto.  Upon the invitation of a friend of mine, I joined her for lunch at the newly established restaurant that I had heard NOTHING about, specializing in Soba noodles, which I had only enjoyed in yakisoba.  Headed by one of the prime chefs from Bellagio's famous Picasso restaurant, there is nothing like this restaurant's offering currently in Vegas - no Soba houses to speak of - but thankfully, this restaurant really, really delivers.  Graceful lines and floral arrangements grace the interior.  Service is attentive and friendly, helpful to answer any questions about the presentation or function of the ladle, spicing the broth to enjoy your very healthy, buckwheat soba, etc.    Service was a little slow on the refills of my water and tea, but the food came out quickly, hot, and gorgeously presented.    While the noodles were of course, delicious and I enjoyed being able to flavor my broth myself, I was just beside myself with the appetizers, which chef really shone.  The calamari-stuffed vegetable tempura was the standout in the midst of some excellent dishes, along with fresh, flavourful sushi whose presentation was only matched by the floral arrangements.  I could have equally been happy ordering several appetizers versus an actual entree.    When one ventures into a space such as I-Naba, they're really not just looking for quality food so much as an experience in an unfamiliar realm of cuisine - but the ceremony and care of food from top to bottom was just wonderful and I look forward to returning again.", "Date": "2012-06-16", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Claudia", "ReviewID": "GlAZ5Z7wxDwYTT3w2GSpGA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "This place is as close to the real thing as it can get.  our whole family loves their cold soba and udon dishes!  it has become our favorite lunch joint since we discovered it.  love it!", "Date": "2012-08-31", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Helen", "ReviewID": "L3kF3-Jg0z-NN-gDQ6Tjew", "Overall": "5", "Content": "After a week of eating at great restaurants in Vegas...this place probably served my most favorite meal.

We're definitely coming into our own, rivaling that of LA and evolving into a Japanese foodie hub of the Southwest. And there's definitely demand, every Japanese hotspot is crowded, reviewed by every critic and blogger in town, and in the Top To Do Lists for Dining in Sin City.  Next stop, total world domination!  Muwahaaaaa!  And it's not just the fine establishments that are getting the attention, it's the casual restaurants that truly define a culture and represent the heart and soul of food....                                        Inaba Japanese Soba Noodle is a small chain from LA which serves, as the name suggest, Soba and Udon Noodles... It's another Japanese staple cuisine, where noodles are the hallmark of everyday cuisine, with a variety of different executions from cold Soba Noodles with various accoutrements, to hot steaming bowls of Noodle Soup to warm up the body on a cold day....  We decided to make our way over to the other side of town and get there just as it was opening up for dinner, we thought it would be crowded...it wasn't.  But after a while, people came in  and filling up the restaurant. As is the case in most restaurants off the Strip, the interior is really nothing to write about, except that it's kinda depressing....no ambience to speak of - but we're here for the food so no quips!  We started the meal with a small plate: the Braised Pork Belly which is a favorite of ours. This is a home-cooked comfort food version of the dish, (unlike the polishd, glossy kind you get at the snooty, hoighty, toighty Japanese restaurants on the Strip) with Braised Pork Belly, Carrots and Daikon and Spinach topped with Scallions.  It's served with a side of hot mustard and it is a quintessential comfort food dish. I wasn't overly impressed with the pork, (my piece had a knuckle, so it wasn't belly) so it was a misnomer, however it had all the robustness of the typical dish, (minus the layers of fat) the Daikon was cooked perfectly and the soup was delicious.    I ordered the Nabeyaki Udon, a noodle soup cooked in a pot chock full of delicious ingredients!  The Udon here is not your typical fat noodle, here it's a little thinner but just as tasty, the chewiness of the noodle was orgasmic to the bite and the broth was robust but not overly salty!  On top of the noodle: Shrimp and Vegetable Tempura, Hard Boiled Egg, Salmon, Squid and Greens- it was  a lot of food!  Most Noodle dishes come as a set, so with it came a rice dish -Kakikomi Gohan. A light, subtle flavored rice with vegetables and light seasoning gave a balance to the hot noodle soup, a textural departure..if you will...  A little note about the Gohan (rice)-it's not fried rice, it's actually rice steamed with Vegetables, (for further information and rants: check Yelp,  review by Alex S. is truly informative if not a  little funny to read - he's pretty passionate)!                                                    I keep forgetting that I really can't have hot noodle soup unless my body is below freezing, my head starts to sweat like a waterfall and doesn't end until, luck would have it,  I'm out of the restaurant!  (Btw, the Nabeyaki is like a cauldron...it's boiling hot).   But wanting to try this dish, it did not disappoint - I loved the toppings and I would recommend this to those who love Noodles and really Hot Broth!  Rick ordered the Tendon, (Shrimp Tempura Bowl):  Shrimp and Vegetable Tempura over a bed of Rice with Soy Sauce.  An excellent dish; the Shrimp was fresh, the Tempura batter and frying was well executed and overall I would get this dish again in a heartbeat.  You can get a combination most of the dishes, which is a noodle side dish, either Soba or Udon, and either hot (Kake) or cold (Karu), he ordered the Hot Udon Noodle.  His Udon was great, different than the Nabeyaki, (much simpler with less lava like qualities) it had few toppings but still a simple and great add-on.  This Noodle with Rice Combo is Carb lovers dream and we literally rolled ourselves out the door!  Next time, we have to get the Ten Zaru, (Cold Tempura Soba Noodles with Tempura), it's my favorite and perfect on a hot day!! Also, I want to try more of the small plates: Zuke Tororo, (Marinated Tuna with Yam and Quail Egg) the Battera, (Cured Mackerel over pressed Sushi Rice) and the Hirame Kobujime, (Kelp-infused Halibut with Ume-Shiso over Pressed Sushi Rice).  In any case, it is a much welcomed addition to the collection of top quality Japanese restaurants that our fair city has accumulated, and Inaba stands out with its focus on noodles, awesome concept and great delivery!!!

Granted I never had their freshest noodles, but they're good enough for me to come back slurping for more.  Inaba is noted for their hand made soba; however, this particular store get their noodles from their California's counterpart biweekly.    Zaru Soba is the thing to get here.  It is known.  Perfect for a hot summer day or anytime really. Comes with a simple bowl of Fried Rice, Soba Tsuyu (dipping sauce usually some sort of dashi, mirin, soysauce, sugar?), and scallion and wasabi to tweak your dipping sauce.  Soba are made out of buckwheat flour but wheat is commonly added to bind the noodles together.  The flavor is a delicate.  It's kind of hard to describe but its a little rustic and earthy.  I usually put all the wasabi and chopped scallions in the dipping sauce and have at it.  Don't be afraid to slurp.  More air to the back of your nose heighten your taste buds.  When you are finished ask for a side of Soba-Yu.  It's the water full of nutrient from cooking the noodles.  Add to your Soba Tsuyu and drink up.  Simple and healthy for you.  BUT my greatest obsession is their Chirashi Bowl. Beautiful arrangements of Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail, Scallop, Shwimp, Squid wrapped in Shisho Leaf, Tamago (egg), Marinated Chopped Tuna, Salmon Roe, Shisho Leaf, Gari (sushi ginger), Daikon Radish Sprouts, and Nori (shredded seaweed) all on a bed of tasty sushi rice.  Chirashi rice usually contain more rice vinegar than in nigiri or sushi rolls, so you don't need a lot of soy sauce to dip your fish in.  They do give you a ramekin of soy sauce and sometimes bits of fresh Wasabi as well.  There's so much going on in this bowl of goodness that it'll always keep me craving for more.    Eating both the Zaru Soba (Buckwheat Noodles with dipping sauce) and Chirashi Bowl can be a challenge because the sushi bowl comes with a house salad.  The add-on of a small side of soba for $4 if you dont want a full serving. The miso sesame ginger dressing that comes with the salad is savory.  I usually just dip my chopsticks in the dressing and pick up a few greens to eat.  Service is polite and quick.

Small menu of some appetizers, cold and hot noodles, drinks, and desserts.  This visit, i had ordered the vegetable ten zaru, which was a cold soba noodle served with shrimp and vegetable tempura on the side.   On the table, there is a little description on the healthiness of eating soba. Quite informative to read.   Each person is given  water  which has some flavoring in it. Something close to the barley tea water you get at some korean restaurants?   Each order is brought in it's own individual tray, and each item separated in its own individual dish. Other than what i had listed above for my order, it also came with a little fried rice like thing that tasted quite nice. Nothing too flavorful but still good. The soba sauce came with a side plate with wasabi and green onions, and a plate of some seasoned, perhaps sea salt that you can add to the sauce as well depending on your own preference. I added all the green onions but a little wasabi and salt for the experience. Luckily, i only added a little of the wasabi, because that wasnt really something i had liked. Haha.   But back to the main course. The soba was cooked beautifully, nice and al dente. The tempura was freshly fried, and crispy. Everything was flavored nicely. Nothing overpowering but was refreshing because it was a cold noodle dish on a hot day.  As i had mentioned briefly earlier, there is a health benefit to eating soba. One is that you drink the rest of your soba sauce with the soba water that will be given to you, during your meal. What the health benefit was, i dont remember, but hey, why not?   Price wise it was fairly decent. Range from i believe 10 - 14 dollars depending on which  combination soba  you get. As for other items, im not sure.

The design of the menu is traditional in a sense, typical Japanese menu opening left to right, but the menu itself is all in English. They had an assortment of appetizers, cold and hot soba, drinks and dessert.   The price itself is reasonable, for a lunch plate that I had which was a shrimp and vegetable ten zaru it came out to be around $15.  The food was pretty good, everything was separated as it should be. I didn't have problems with the service though it did take about half an hour to get our food, which to me is normal at any restaurant. The soba was perfect, not too soft or hard, just the way it should be. The tempura was fresh and not overly battered.   Overall I liked the place and price.

While I think that they are doing something different that's kinda unique here, it really didn't blow me away like I feel it should have.  Nabeyaki udon - they made it with these really thick udon noodles which I never had before, and I thought that it was different, but really didn't do anything for me. I wish there were more vegetables like carrots and mushrooms. They did put in a tempura kabocha, but it was undercooked. The shrimp tempera was cooked really well and and had a light, crisp batter. The soft boiled egg was cooked nicely. The broth was ok, just a bit too sweet for my taste. I thought for $12 bucks it was a little too pricey for what I received.  I have been here and tried their yakisoba, and while the soba noodles are a lot different than what I have had in the past, it didn't really do anything for me.  Service wasn't really that great. We had to share menus. Is it really that hard to order more menu cases and print out some more menus? I guess so. She also didn't know who ordered what. Maybe the kitchen gets confused as well.

I love this place! I've came here a few times for lunch and once for dinner. I know I-Naba is THE place if you want soba but I honestly am not a huge fan of soba ... but, they also have udon. Now, I LOVE udon and I simply adore the ones at I-Naba.   No, there's nothing particularly special and out of the world at I-Naba but you will find something quite comforting: noodle in hot soups! Not only do they have those but they also have sushi to their menu, although not as extensive as some would want it to be.   So far, I've tried their Niku (beef) with soba/udon in hot soup, salmon and ikura with sushi rice bowl, and nabeyaki udon.   I simply love their udon. I prefer my udon on the thicker side and I love how al-dente it is. Its still got a bite to the noodles! Yummy! Their niku udon is solid. As for their nabeyaki, they say it's got seafood and chicken and it does. It has clams, squid, and a piece of delicious salmon in it. However, I would've probably liked it more if it had more veggies. I don't particularly care for the clams or squid ... but the salmon was yummy!   Their salmon and ikura bowl was really good as well. Their salmon is cut on the thinner side but it always looks and tastes fresh. Same for their ikura. Sometimes I just want this bowl with some udon ...and for lunch, they have that! They have a combo where you get udon with a smaller version of the salmon and ikura bowl. However, the type of noodles in the combo that you get are a thinner version of the udon.   Anywhos, I've never had a bad meal here and the prices are decent. I also don't have anything bad to say.

So I did my research. Good thing I did because there's a right way to eat it and I never would have been able to figure it out on my own. I-naba does have directions on the table, but I recommend reading up on it beforehand. My first time eating soba in a restaurant was a fantastic experience. I will be back.  The waitress that day was so insanely kind. She was patient and willing to answer questions. In fact a solicitor came in asking each table for donations. She approached the woman and said in the sweetest voice,  Please leave now. Thank you.  The solicitor kindly left.  I ate two things: Battera Small Plate- 6 thin pieces of cured mackerel on vinegary sushi rice forming a perfect rectangle. Excellent. Vegetable Ten Zaru- served on a tray you receive vegetable tempura (yam, asparagus, mushroom, etc), dipping sauce for tempura, small bowl of rice, cold soba noodles on a basket thing called a zaru, and the soba dipping sauce. The dipping sauce is salty and savory. Grab a bite full of noodles, dip the last end into the sauce, and let that end sit in there as you eat the clean noodles from your chopsticks. Enjoy the flavor of the clean noodles and when you get to the sauce soaked part you will enjoy the contrast. When you finish the meal set aside your dipping sauce. They bring the water the soba was cooked in. Pour that water right in the cup up to the top and enjoy it like a soup. Those first sips can be pretty salty so keep adding the soba water to dilute it.  I am satisfied with the portion and meal experience here. Although I could see how super hungry people who crave meat in every meal may not be contented.  They do have beer here, not bad selection either. They had Asahi, Innis & Gunn and Samuel Smith. Looks great inside too, very comfortable and calm.

The soba noodles were thin and cooked perfectly (not too hard, not too soft). The dipping sauce was refreshing and made just right, not very salty, but not bland either. They were sooo good that I wish the portion size was bigger, but I guess you can't go wrong for $8. If you are looking to eat light, this is definitely a good place! My husband liked the soba as well. He liked the Katsu-Don, but they did put a lot of green onions in it. Ewww. We were disappointed that they no longer had the  Green Tea Trio  for dessert. Our server told us that they had it a long time ago, when they had a chef dedicated to only making desserts. But not anymore. :( So I ordered the green tea ice cream and my husband ordered the Shiratama Anmitsu. Normally I don't really care for green tea ice cream, but this one was actually very good. The green tea flavor wasn't overpowering like how it usually is everywhere else. It was light and tasted more like a sorbet.   I like how most of their food is freshly made in-house. The servers were very polite, friendly and attentive as well. I think the only bad thing about this place is their hours.

It's a cute and casual little place that's easy to find, on the corner of Desert Inn and Decatur. There are potted plants lining the outside and scattered throughout the inside, which makes it seem very natural and neighborhood-friendly. The way tables were set up was very eclectic, lacking that straight-line formation most restaurants use.  The waitress was very helpful and friendly. I particularly appreciated the fact that she didn't judge me for smelling everything and just seemed to be amused by my quirks. Thank you, kind waitress. I tipped you well.  The menu is simple and there are neat little info cards on all the tables describing the nutritional value and components of soba noodles. Now this is what I'm talking about! Love it so much.  I could describe every aspect of I-Naba word-for-word...Except the soba noodles. I can't quite describe it. All I can say is that the noodles are perfectly firm and the dipping broth is mild but somehow maintains its flavor. I got the batteru combo so it came with cold soba and four pieces of pressed mackerel sushi. I normally don't like mackerel but this was just so soft and delicious.  When I finished my meal, the waitress gave me sobayu (the water used to cook the soba) which you mix with the dipping broth and drink it as soup. The sobayu on its own smelled very sweet and fragrant. I literally sat there and inhaled the steam for a good few minutes (this is where the waitress seemed amused).

The waitress was just hiding in the backroom the entire time. When she brought me my food, she brought me the water as well--lukewarm water in a tiny cup! What. The. Hell? I know people who order water seem cheap, but can't I get a normal glass and some ice? Other people, who got soda, got normal glasses and ice. Since I was thirsty I had to down the cup and I was never refilled--which is pretty bad when everything you're eating is salty.   Then, while I was half way through my meal, she came up while I was eating and asked me if I'd like to order anything else and HANDED ME THE BILL. What? Seriously, who trained her? You do not hand someone the bill while they are eating. You're telling them to eat and get out as fast as possible. I'm paying $12+ for a meal; I'm in no hurry to get out, and I didn't show any signs that I was in a hurry (because I wasn't). If she wasn't so gloomy, she might have ripped the food out from under me and pulled the money out of my wallet before shoving me out the door.  Again, the service wasn't horrible. I just don't want to go a restaurant to feel depressed and disrespected. The food and the environment was good, the waitress and the service I received was bad. I really do hope other people have experienced better service, or this was a one off thing. Still, there is no excuse for this.

Their menu has expanded a bit from when they first opened, but I won't go into that, you can see the menu here : http://www.inabalasvegas.com/#!menu/vstc1=brunch I-Naba also offers specials in their menu in store that include an appetizer, entree, and dessert for those who would like to partake on a more complete lunch.   My personal favorites are the zuke tuna bowl with hot udon combo ($12) or the battera (cured mackerel sushi). The hot udon increases my heart rate and makes my nose runny because I'm slurping its umami deliciousness so quickly. Just like smelling a pineapple to see if it's ripe, I use my runny nose to tell me whether or not I'm having a great bowl of hot noodles.   I've never had a problem with the service, any language barrier issues, or my drinks being filled, BUT sometimes I'm sad when I go there on Tuesday's and they're not opened :(.

We usually share the Chirashi Combination ($14) and have it with cold Udon.  I love their little chirashi - it's the perfect size for lunch and the price can't be beat.  The Husband usually eats up the udon on his own.  (I did once make the mistake of eating all the chirashi and udon myself and I was beyond full.)  Sometimes their chirashi can be such a pleasant surprise with scallops and the like.  Other times, it's filled with the standard tuna, salmon, and ikura.  I was actually disappointed that squid wrapped with shiso wasn't in my most recent order.  Sometimes we throw in a few of their other items:  * Kakuni ($6) - Braise black pork belly, enough said.  * Salmon Oshizushi ($7) - It's pressed cured salmon with salmon eggs.  The Little Guy loves salmon eggs, so that's why we added this to our order.  It's something we've only ordered once and not again though.  * Nasu Agedashi ($5) - Fried eggplant served in a dashi broth and more salmon eggs.  Again, this was something we ordered because of the extra ikura, but not something that we have since repeated.  * Roasted Chilean Seabass - This one came off their Specials board and it was so yummy!  Great choice.  * Sesame Trio Dessert - Again, another one from the Specials Board and what a treat!  The creme brulee, the macaron, and the ice cream were all so good!   Service - we love when we are remembered and the waitress automatically brings a bowl and silverware for the Little Guy.  She also remembered our egg allergy and came out after our order was put in to remind me that I didn't request tamago out of my chirashi!  Yay for her!

The interior decor was very simple and bring surrounded by all Japanese customers made this place all the more authentic. With all the meals, excluding the 'small bites' come with your choice of either soba or udon noodles with a cold or hot broth. We ordered a variety of small bites including fried soba chips which were buckwheat chips served with a side of wasabi guacamole. Next we ordered the calamari with stuffed vegetables lightly battered and fried served with a side of tempura sauce. The braised black pork belly followed after. Overall the presentation for the food was amazing but the taste was not so impressive, merely just okay. The chips were simple, and tasted just like wonton chips; calamari was very tough and chewy, but the taste itself was well balanced with the herbs and carrots; finally the black pork belly was good but lacking the full robust flavor like the one from Goyemon. For entree we ordered Battera sushi ( 4 pieces of mackerel nigiri served with cold soba noodles), chirashi sushi bowl (as seen in Seven Magazine served with hot udon noodles), and the Tori Udon (served with chicken and egg). As mentioned before the presentation was exquisite but again lacking the 'wow' feature. Dont get me wrong, the noodles were well cooked and the broth was savory, but it tastes like any other both you can get from another Japanese restaurant. For dessert we orders the buckwheat crepe served with side of red bean, ice cream, and topped with walnuts and honey. The crepe itself was very soft and spongy and okay.   When you come to I-Naba, this place makes you think about what a traditional Japanese noodle house would look feel, and taste like. Very simplistic place to get dinner! I think this place would've been more enjoyable if our food came out faster. Although the place was small, when it's full with people maybe the cooks can't crank out the order as fast.

The zaru soba: I make better packaged zaru soba at home.  The mini ten-don bowl: the shrimp tempura was the best part of our entire meal. The kabocha (pumpkin) was under cooked and still HARD.

My first time experiencing Soba noodles and this level of authenticity in Japanese cuisine, and it was fantastic.  I hope my next comment doesn't offend anyone, but when I'm in a restaurant that serves a regional cuisine, and both the staff, and the customers hail from that region, I know it's going to be good.  Inaba falls in this category.  My fellow friends and Yelpers joined me for dinner Wednesday night, and we all left pretty satisfied.  Here are some general notes from our experience:  The Ambience - The restaurant was playing some very quiet music in the background which was nice (Japanese interpretation of Canon in D)  The room only has about 12 tables, and is decorated with muted tones of bamboo, greys, and blacks.  Peaceful is a good way to describe this place.   The Menu - Page one of the two page menu explains a little bit about the noodles, the tradition of this type of cuisine, and why it is so special  (it is).  Be sure to read it!  The other page features a few small plates, and various Soba and Udon dishes, both hot and cold.     The Food - We ordered Kakuni (Braised Pork Belly)  Salmon Oshizuki (pressed cured salmon on top of sushi rice w/ salmon roe) and the Sansai Tororo w/ Soba (buckwheat noodles w/ mountain vegetables and grated yam)    Kukuni -  It was flavorful, but not quite as tender as I've had in other places.  It was a nice way to start the meal, but not my favorite bite of the night.  Salmon Oshizuki - A bit too much rice for my liking, but again this was simple and tasty.  Sansai Tororo w/ Soba - WOW!  The flavors were subtle and delicate.  If you are not used to this cuisine, you really need to treat it like classical music, and look for the beauty of the subtle flavor nuances.  Just because it's not blaring and loud, doesn't mean it's not great!  The broth was a dashi/soy broth with no oil sitting on the surface and just the right balance of salt.  The veggies were crisp enough to give texture, but stayed in line with the rest of the dish.    Inaba is in the infant stages of greatness.  The menu will be updated as time goes on, with new items making appearances.

They have a variety of hot/cold udon or soba and rice bowl sets to choose from as well as a la carte. I chose set G with salad, cold soba and a chirashi bowl. The soba noodles had a soft chewy texture, I believe it's handmade! And what I liked was they put the noodles into the cold soba broth so I didn't need to dip my noodles in with each bite [for the lazy eaters]. And the broth wasn't too overpowering or anything. It was just perfect. The sashimi tasted very fresh. The chirashi came with a slice of tuna, salmon, scallop, shrimp, tamago, and spicy tuna at the bottom over the rice with seaweed strips sprinkled on top. I'm usually not a fan of spicy tuna but there's is amazing! It's not mushed up like other places but just chopped into cubes where the fish is still whole so I don't feel like I'm getting any fillers in it like the usual spicy tuna. I-Naba's spicy tuna has a kick tho!! They mix it with fresh wasabi which was amazing. I definitely recommend this set! I was full off of this but if you're a big eater tho.. Go ahead and order the noodles and bowl separately since the sets are half orders of each. Ah and the salad dressing was veryy yummy too and I'm not even a fan of dressing on my salad.

I didn't grow up eating soba, and at first glance these dishes seem simple and expensive.  After trying soba noodles at other restaurants, I can say that I-Naba delivers the most balanced and satisfying soba dishes that I've tried.  Whether served cold or hot, in the summer or winter, I-Naba completely satisfies me in a way that few restaurants manage to do.  Choosing your meal involves a few choices, none of which will disappoint you.  Decide on the type of dish (hot or cold), type of noodle (soba or udon), and if you want a combo or not.  Combos include several options to eat with your noodles, including tempura, sashimi, and a variety of vegetables.

The service is 1 star.  I'd give it 0 if I could.  This review is based on two separate occasions.  The first time I went there, it was a late lunch at about 2-3P on a weekend.  There were only two other tables occupied when I entered and they were midway completed with their meal before we were even seated.  I have my 5 year old with us.  So when the waitress comes up to our table, I ask,  What's good for kids?   Her response,  Kids?   I said,  Yes, kids.  What do children normally order?   She says,  Children?   I say,  Yes, children.  What do children usually get here?   And she says,  Get?   At this point, I can tell this is going nowhere.  But trying not to lose it and be polite, I say,  Is there a kids menu?  since some restaurants have a separate kids menu.  And again, she says  Kids?   So I point to other table and I say,  What did those kids order?   She says,  Kids like noodles.   Keep in mind that about half the menu comprises noodles.  So I say,  Which noodles?   And she says,  Which noodles?   So by now, I'm a bit turned off and just order without the waitress' input.  I'm not sure where they get their staff from.  It seems like they just flew in from Asia and handed them a uniform.  I'm not being difficult or picky.  I myself am 100% asian and my mother also tried to speak to her in Japanese with zero success.  She's over 70 and was disgusted.  She is also 100% Japanese.  The food came out about 45 minutes later.  Luckily, I had my phone to keep my kid occupied.  Otherwise, we would've left and gone to McDonalds.  The second time, I plan ahead and try to be smart about it.  I call ahead and ask if it's crowded or if there is a wait because it's dinnertime and a holiday weekend.  They said the restaurant is mostly empty.  So we truck on down there.  As luck would have it, the second trip is worst than the first.  I see a party of 7 walk in right when we do.  Knowing that these people move at turtle speed and trying to order before the party of 7, I tell the hostess that I am ready to order before we even hit the seats.  And what does she do?  She walks away and brings ONE menu for a party of 5.  I have no idea what she's doing and I say,  I'm ready to order  again.  And what does she do?  She walks away and brings four more menus.  So at this point, I'm worried.  I say,  We don't need more menus.  I said I'm ready to order.   So we place our order and I watch her carefully as she goes to the party of 7 and takes their order without putting our order in.  And of course, I sit there for an hour while my 5 year old yells out,  What is taking so long?   And of course, the party of 7 gets their food before our party of 5 despite placing our order first.  My 80 yr old father who can barely walk is outraged, feels compelled to go to the  manager  and asks what is taking so long.  The restaurant is less than half full.  They apologize profusely and say the other tables' order is simple and that's why they got their food first.  Simple?  Simple?  Seriously?  How hard is it to slice fish, put it on rice and cook noodles for 5 minutes and put it in a bowl?  How do I know this?  Not only do I love soba, I've cooked it myself at home at least 30 times.  All five of us ordered the same exact item.  It's not like we ordered unique items per person.  They could have mass produced each component and threw it on the plate.  Let's face it, Soba is basically ramen.  You cook it and give you a bowl of pre-made sauce.  It's not like they are making the actual noodles from scratch the moment it's ordered.  They had one waitress, one manager, and what must've been one cook for a holiday dinner time slot.  Unreal.  So why a 3 star rating?  They gave us a discount on the bill and the food is good.  I tell the manager that if they cannot handle 5 identical orders with a restaurant is less than half full on a holiday weekend at dinner, what would it be like if they were at capacity or had a line?  She apologized profusely again, agreed with me and said that our party and the other party arrived at the same time.  Still no excuse.  It was two tables in a restaurant that was 1/4 full when we got there.  Bottom line, don't bother unless you can wait an hour plus for noodles and a chirashi bowl that should take 20 minutes tops.  I will NOT ever return.  You have been warned.  Inaba employees, management and owners:  I hope you read this because you have a lot to learn about managing a business.  Have you ever wondered that the reason why your restaurant is half full is because you cannot support a full restaurant?  And now your restaurant will be even more empty because I will not return and will tell everyone under the sun to never go there regardless of how great your soba is or ever will be.", "Date": "2012-09-06", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Valerie", "ReviewID": "uzQVanNaK9F-n7H2UdQhbA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Authentic and delicious.

Although the soba is not made from scratch on the premise by a resident soba master, I've heard that it is shipped in from their sister restaurant in Torrance, where it is made fresh daily with imported Japanese buckwheat flour.      To summarize my three trips here, I've included my take on various offerings:  Appetizers:  Chawanmushi-  velvety egg custard with seafood, similar in quality to Kyara across town, with slightly better price point ($4 vs $5) Battera- Holy smokes/Holy mackerel this is some nice thinly pressed smoked mackerel atop well seasoned vinegar rice!  Entrees: Chirashi bowl- beautifully arranged assortment of sashimi and roe over sushi rice, strongly recommend pairing with the cold Zaru soba   Noodles: In the dilemma between hot and cold soba, I felt that the cold soba was the clearcut favorite for me (I've also gathered from reading other reviewers that their udon is not the typical thick chewy noodle, but a thinner softer variety so you've been warned)  The Zaru soba is simply plain chilled soba noodles served on an artistic bamboo basket (zaru)  with some shredded nori and accompanied by some scallions, wasabi, and dipping sauce of mirin, dashi, and soy sauce.  Proper technique is to take a few strand of noodles with the chopsticks, dunk the bottom half of the noodles into the cup with the dipping sauce (some like to add the scallions and wasabi into the dipping cup whereas placing them directly onto the soba can intensify their flavors), and it is encouraged to slurp them into your mouth so that you first get the taste of pure buckwheat flavor followed by the combined flavor of all the ingredients together.  The texture and inherent flavor of the noodle is best appreciated in this form and it is a very refreshing afternoon meal especially in the summertime although I also didn't mind eating it during my last visit in the wintertime.   Drinks: Yuzu limeade with mint- bubbly, tart and mildly sweet, akin to a very refreshing non-alcoholic Asian mojito Soba tea- the broth from which the soba is cooked is chalk full of vitamins B1, B2, and rutin (good for lowering blood pressure and a potent antioxidant to boot) and the gracious staff presents it at the close of the meal which can be consumed as is or combined with the dipping sauce as a nice hot broth.    While our Western palates are conditioned to routinely appreciate an unctuous hunk of pork belly or a rich and gooey mac and cheese, it's nice to occasionally balance it out with foods more subtle and delicate, producing a much cleaner finish and leaving an overall sense of wellness rather than having a cloying aftertaste and feeling overstuffed.  Inaba offers a wide array of items that accomplishes just that so best to not arrive ravenously hungry and be sure to set your AYCE sushi cravings on the wayside when approaching this oasis of zen accompanied by the soothing tunes of their never-ending playlist of Beatles/Michael Jackson muzak.", "Date": "2013-01-11", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Warren", "ReviewID": "onOKwT9I7QQpbDmhrmn3LQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "B est hand made soba in Town.

My only complaint with the tempura is I would have liked more grated daikon, otherwise it was just okay too.  The star of the meal, the soba, was above average. It was cooked the way I like, a little chewy and still able to absorb the dipping sauce. They even serve you a portion of the water the noodles were cooked in to make a soup from the dipping sauce, pretty authentic!  The service was also above average. Not only was my ice tea refilled regularly and without prompting, I mean with two servers and only four table I would hope so, but I was not made to feel rushed when the other tables finished their meals and left. The servers were not eyeballing me to hurry and leave so they could close up, which is always nice.  My only complaint would be the prices/value.

I grew up eating cold soba noodles. My mom would make them to keep cool during the hot Summer months. And I loved them! However, the noodles I ate were dried in a package thats probably been sitting on the shelf for a year. And the sauce came pre-made in a bottle. I first came across 'real' soba last year in California. So my heart skipped a beat to find out Inaba was joining the family of authentic Japanese restaurants in town.  SOBA: Chilled buckwheat noodles topped with nori were served alongside a bowl of tsuyu (sauce). I added the scallion and wasabi and got to dipping. A noodle is a noodle is a noodle--NOT. Noodles, like everything else have flavor. And in a soba dish, especially one served cold, the taste and bite of a noodle can make it or break it. This excellent dish can only be described as delicate, fresh, and clean. After I finished my noodles, my server brought over a cup of the water the soba noodles were cooked in. You mix the hot water with the tsuyu and drink. He informed me that its full of vitamins and very good for you! The soba was also served with a side of fried rice. A dash of soy sauce and some togarashi, it didn't stand a chance.  VARIETY: With the warm weather upon us, I needed a refreshing pick-me-up. But there are hot soup options available which I will be digging into next time. The star of our appetizers was the Battera Mackerel. In traditional Osaka style, the mackerel is served square. The filet is pressed in a box which results in a thin piece of fish and its cube shape. It was unusual, but it is now my favorite mackerel in Las Vegas. It was cured just right! The Nasu (Eggplant) Agedashi was lightly fried and served just like my usual agedashi tofu. Although delicious, I would've liked the eggplant a little softer. I ordered the sausages for my friend who needed something particularly savory. But I stole one for myself. Tasty, but skippable.  DRINKS: Boricha (roasted barley tea) is served in place of water. I believe you can order hot tea for an added cost. And I didn't see any alcohol on the menu either.  SERVICE: The two servers were so polite it hurt. I love the Japanese. They were sweet-natured and apologized for the smallest of infractions.  Like my eating partner, I can imagine many people leaving here underwhelmed and dissatisfied. How many people do you know would leave the house for cold soup? But for those of us who can appreciate the simplicity of Japanese cooking, this specialty restaurant is doing everything right.

The soba noodles just tasted like anything else I've ever had made of buckwheat, and the broth, while soothing as all soup broth is to me, was just too subtle for my liking.   It's quite possible that's the point, that maybe it provides a level of elegance that my tastebuds either just that day or in general might lack a craving for.  I much found myself yearning for a rich ramen broth instead.  I thought the veggie tempura tasted fairly standard, which is to say they were tasty, but they didn't seem fresh out the deep fryer, which is to say they were a little cold.

Zaru soba is the way to go here for me personally as I'm not very fond of warm soba or udon for that matter.

I didn't expect much, but the cuts in general were better than I expected. The fish isn't served chilled though, but that didn't bother me.

And these noodles are the bomb! But low-carb dieters, beware! There's a lot of starch going on here ... and that's a good thing.  I had never had cold soba noodles before, but after reading the reviews on Yelp, I thought I would give them a try. My husband prefers udon to soba, so he stuck with the fatties. We both ordered off the lunch menu: eel tempura on rice, and cold soba noodles in broth with eggplant and daikon for me; and salmon sashimi with salmon roe on rice, and cold udon noodles in broth with tempura shrimp and vegetables for him. Both were perfectly paired, and the broth-to-noodle ratio was great. I loved my eel and only wish there were a little more of it. The salmon roe added a nice fishy quality to my husband's rice, and while we both liked the udon, we agreed that the soba was the better choice.  We planned to try the battera as an appetizer, but they were out of it. But there was plenty of food to go around -- too much, in fact, for us to finish! I also had a yuzu limeade, which was a little too tart for my taste, and the whole meal was around $40 (with tip), which was more than reasonable for the amount of food we received.  We plan to go back to I-Naba to try some of their other tempting menu items, including black cod (my favorite!) and the aforementioned battera. And maybe next time I will order the cold soba noodles as a side dish, so I can experience them plain with a side of dipping sauce.

The soba noodles were a bit hard and it looked like they were left overs since they were all broken up lil pieces of noodles (all about 1  -1.5  long). Noodles were a bit disappointing, but the tempura was good. My husband decided to order the salmon appetizer too which looked good and was pretty good minus the fact that the rice to salmon ratio was like 2:1. I really liked how he brought out the hot soba broth to mix with the soba sauce at the end to close the meal.

I needed food that was not rich or abundant or anything extravagant.  I needed simple, elegant food and that's what is served at I-Naba.  Going off strip when one does not have one's own car is always difficult.  It's easy to tell the taxi cab  Bellagio  or  MGM  and they know exactly where to take you. . . True it's not exactly rocket science to notice a huge casino/hotel down one road.  But say that you want to go off strip to a small restaurant and you're in trouble.  Word of advice - give them nearby major intersections and for I-Naba look for the  Nana Noodles  sign.  The restaurant and menu is small and simple. . . Initially I had my heart set on the Chirashi with soba combination as advertised on their website but I could not resist a 4-course tasting menu for $18 obviously with wine pairing for the first two courses(add $7).  Course 1 - three pieces of cured mackeral nigiri.  Now I'm not a fan of saba to begin with so cured saba was not my thing.  The shape was unique, completely squared, which I found difficult to eat with.  Course 2 - Tempura fish cake/shrimp and eggplant.  Let me explain, the shrimp is blanketed with fish cake and the whole thing is deep fried tempura style, served with grilled eggplant and in some soy sauce.  It was lovely.  Course 3 - Hot udon soup with a side of fried rice.  THE. BEST. UDON I have had.  The noodles were not as big as I would expect it to be (yes that's what she said for you immature folks out there) but it was the right size for me and absolutely delicious.  The broth was very nice, not too salty, not too bland.  Course 4 - Honey covered yogurt with frest fruit.  The service was great and attentive. . . We asked our server if she would not mind calling a cab to pick us up and informed us that the cab is due to arrive in 15 min.  15 min?!  Ok, we'll walk around the shopping center and maybe buy a huge thing of water for our hotel room, we just rounded the shopping center when our waitress came running after us telling us that the cab called with an update that he will be arriving in 2 min instead.

Getting back to my review, the people who work here are Japanese and I like that because it makes the atmosphere seem authentic. Also a lot of the cliental when I come in are always Japanese.  I order the limeade because it is homemade and tastes like a mojito mix, which I love mojitos.  On to the food! So experimented around, ordering hot/cold, appetizers, the specials, and there hasn't been a complaint about any of it. I love the noodles and I love getting my hot water for the sauce to turn into soup after.  The service regardless if they were slammed or empty as always been attentive to my orders and needs.  My only issues are about the portions, I feel that because although it might be just right for me it is lacking in the size for others. I feel that every time I bring a friend to eat with the portion is not enough and they have to order more.

Their technique was ok.   I really like that they offer cold tea but let you ask for hot tea. The ambience was really quaint and the place was simply decorated for a home-feel. They had soothing instrumental Beatles music playing. Many Japanese were there paying their patronage.  There wasn't much special done to their chilled broth and the rice that came with the meal must have been sitting in the rice warmer for a while. It didn't complement or accent the soba very well. It had the slightest taste of soy added to it, but not any other real flavor. I did like that the eggplant (nasu) in the chilled broth was warm. The eggplant was done quite well.   Their noodles provide a moment of zen, just like what Steve W. said. Their service is pretty good, except I find their way of giving a check somewhat inefficient because they bring a little cup and after you leave money in the little cup, they seem to be expecting exact change because they don't check on you for a long while. We were almost going to switch out our bills for smaller bills when the server finally came to check on us.   I know... they're the only ones in town doing soba. But I have had really good noodles.
