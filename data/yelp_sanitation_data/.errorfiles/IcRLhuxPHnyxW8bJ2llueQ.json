This place is nearby UNLV, right behind the 7/11, so it may be a bit hard to find if you are driving there for the first time. Each cronut cost 3.20, which is a small price to pay for a baked good. I enjoyed their raspberry filled cronut. Their bacon was a bit too salty for my liking, but overall, it's a sweet treat! The baker that help us out said that they usually have them freshly baked in the morning around 7am and again at 2pm. So next time we head there, it will be bright and early! haha.

I bought the $3 maple bacon cronut cause i guess its best seller and wow! diabetes started calling!!! lol  The donut is sweat already. on top of that was some cream dashed with powdered sugar. In the middle has more cream that multiplied the sweetness level by 20.

Instead of going to my go to apple fritter, I opted for the chocolate glazed buttermilk donut and a regular chocolate glaze.   I waited to consume them until I walked across to UNLV. Maybe I could give one to my friend and not completely sabotage all my hard work. The longer they sat in my hands, the more I regretted buying them. By the time I sat down, I was dreading my next workout. When I finally broke into the chocolate buttermilk, I was puzzled. It gave way too easily. Then I bite into it and it reminded me of an angel food cake. What the hell was this? The taste of such a decadent treat comes in such a deceiving package. I am not angry that it was not the normal dense cake. Instead I am more angry with how fast I devoured the thing. There was not even an ounce of remorse and no heavy sinking brick lining my stomach.

When I walked in I noticed the shop looked run down and looked like every other old school donut shop that has never been remodeled. They did not have any cinnamon sugar cronuts or simple flavors, most were cream filled and had excess ingredients that made the cronut fattier than it already is. I asked the woman working possibly the owner, if she could make me a cinnamon sugar one and she said yes. She told me the price was $3 something and I thought it was a little high for the size; for the area and type of donut shop I was purchasing it from. I decided to give it a try any way and also ordered a maple, glazed, and white frosting with rainbow sprinkles donut. The glazed was the best of the three and the least dry. Both the maple and rainbow frosting donut tasted old and dry. Cronut tasted artificial and was a tad too greasy.

Big thumbs up.  If you're not originally from Vegas and grew up some place like Chicago or Houston, you probably remember a shop like Al's Donuts from when you grew up.  A family-run donut place with all the classic donuts (chocolate raised, cake, blueberry, cruller, etc), some generic but warm coffee, juice choices, and folks stopping in on their way to work to grab a dozen donuts.  In that way, Al's Donuts tastes like a little bit of history -- not fancy, just simple and well-done.  Al's does a great job with its pastries. The donuts are homemade and fried on spot.  They're not overly sugary (like Krispy Kreme) and not smooth to the touch (like Dunkin Donuts).  Instead, you can feel the rough texture that came from the fryer and the fried taste comes along with the chocolate and sugar to produce an excellent taste.  Not a simply sweetness upon sweetness, but a combination of fried dough and sweet.  I'm a huge fan.    And the customer service is great.  The guy who owns the place can normally be found working.

It was soft, delicate, and basically reminded me of a croissant except in donut form. Are kronuts deep fried? The vanilla frosting was a bit strange, but the texture of the kronut was just right.

By free reign, I mean we were able to choose from the three flavors they have: chocolate, maple and vanilla. I opted to try the chocolate and maple. We didn't order any regular donuts.  This donut shop is right across from UNLV, on the corner or Harmon and Maryland. It's small and not particular noteworthy and a little on the dingy side. The pastries were large and a little overly sweet for my taste. I love powdered sugar, but they were covered in them, so it was a bit of overkill.

Prior to this year, I only had their donuts once which were pretty good from what I remember. But just like everyone else I came here for the cronuts!

Yesterday I went at 8:30am and they were already out, so I suggest you come here before 8!! I was really disappointed because the employee in the front did ask the kitchen staff to see what was going on in the back and he came back saying no cronuts. Thanks for the effort though! The 2 times I was able to get my hands on them was at 7am and 7:15am so I guess they go pretty fast. I think they make batches periodically throughout the day to keep them fresh. So far I've tried the strawberry and the raspberry cronuts. The strawberry was honestly nothing special, but I absolutely loved the raspberry!!! Maybe because the raspberry had a glaze on top unlike strawberry one. People here are giving Al's bad reviews, you kidding me?! Take it from me and try the raspberry and your intuition to venture for the cronut will be fulfilled!

Whenever I have a chance to stick it to the man, I'll do it.  The place was friendly and not hard to find. I got co-worker doughnuts and everyone said they were better than Krispy Kreme which I assume is true because I have not been to Krispy Kreme since like 2008. Not big on doughnuts, people but also not hot for  big doughnut .  A lot of other people seem to be focusing on the negatives of getting doughnuts at Al's so let me share my personal negative thoughts on the place:  The box they came in was super annoying. Brown instead of pink, can you imagine!?  The price was so low I couldn't even guilt trip people about how I spent tons of cash getting doughnuts for them. Way to take the fun out of giving!  The didn't have any diet doughnuts OR any baby panda doughnuts, caviar doughnuts or any other rich person type flavors that would show off my classy status. Aaaaaaaaand, I'm being sarcastic....

Harmon at the corner of Maryland Parkway, kind of tucked away in the back corner of a little shopping complex. You'll find plenty of seating inside though and it was decently clean too, which is always a plus.  When we arrived around 10:30, there wasn't a single customer in the shop and we were surprised to see they still had a decent selection to choose from. Aside from the usual coffee and donuts, they offer a few breakfast sandwiches as well. We ended up ordering only about 8 donuts all together, including 2 kronuts (yes, they spell 'em with a K here) and a couple drinks from the fridge. Our bill was about $20 so I'd suggest sticking with coffee or just doing a pickup if you do come here.  The donuts themselves weren't horrible, but they weren't great either. For the most part, the textures were ok. The regular donuts were really soft but the kronut was lacking in the flakiness department. My biggest problem with pretty much everything we tried, was the taste. Literally everything but the dough itself had a very artificial flavor. From the bacon, to the maple and the worst of them all, the jelly fillings. It's a very distinct artificial flavor that does not put a good taste in your mouth.  For the kronut fanatics out there, I would definitely say it's a no go. There was no kronuts offered without a custard filing and this made them too mushy for me. Another big thing that put me off is how much powdered sugar was on them. I went to take a bite and coughed from inhaling it. It's just overkill.   I didn't get a chance to try any of their regular donuts, like a classic glazed and I imagine they wouldn't be that bad.

Al's Donuts was just down the street. Never knew it was so close to UNLV. - Arrived around 8:00pm and a fresh batch of glazed was just coming out of the oven. - Spied cronuts in the case!  Half a dozen glazed to go is all we got, though. - Dad loved them and said they still tasted good two days later.  He and Mom take a while to eat donuts.  There's nothing like the classic and simple glazed--delicious! - I'll be back to try the cronuts.", "Date": "2013-10-23", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Kim", "ReviewID": "h6iilhT7NXnLxt1TI8E4Pw", "Overall": "2", "Content": "I didn't actually get to eat any donuts.  I came in at 11am on a Saturday and there were only about 10 donuts left.  Just some leftover chocolate ones.  The case was pretty much empty.

Walked into Ed's as a second option to find a mostly empty donut case with a little old lady who barely spoke English telling me she had no plans of making any more. It was noon on a Saturday by the way and they didn't have one chocolate donut on hand. I ended up buying two irregularly sized chocolate bars, and when I got home, found them to be so old and dry, they were inedible. Hence the 1 star. Terrible selection, terrible service, terrible quality, and sub-par establishment.", "Date": "2015-08-01", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Marc", "ReviewID": "mpWRBBWuBaK9FegN_L9CkA", "Overall": "1", "Content": "I've been coming here for years and always liked this place....until now.  This place has a new owner and partnered with a off site bakery. I selected a sesame bagel, a and blueberry loaf slice to go. Before this would cost around $3. They charged me $6.49 (3 for each plus tax)! I asked for that price if they include cream cheese, and of course the answer was  no . It was cold and hard. I just gave it back to the guy and left with the loaf slice. Lesson learned! Never going back there again.  I could understand these high prices if the place was high-end, in a high-end area. But it's a little dive located in a shaby strip mall across from unlv. And being that it's across from unlv, students probably make up a good amount of their clientele. And not many are going to want to pay $3 for a bagel, when you have coffee bean and Einstein Bros walking distance away.  Donuts are kind of an after thought now, and I wonder if they're even made on site anymore.", "Date": "2016-01-12", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Mellany", "ReviewID": "kcQ_oFRKgd_NbdmT0rZY8w", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Al's cronies are pretty delish!

KKs were matter of convenience since my office used to be next to Terrible's gas station. Then I took a year off  donut daily . Then not a long time ago I came across reviews in LV Weekly about local donut shops and voila there's one right down the street from my house: Al's.  Now I look at KKs like at poorly mass-produced product somewhere just above  Hostess  boxed stuff you can get in a grocery store.  Al's stuff is twice larger, twice tastier and twice fresher! And since I'm running few miles almost every morning - simple carbs go verrrrry well  (just finished 2 of them :)", "Date": "2008-04-08", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
