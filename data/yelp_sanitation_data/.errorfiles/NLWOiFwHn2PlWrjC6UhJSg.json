Fat Tuesday does put more alcohol on their slushies but i love the taste here. The flavor was the reason i chose to get their drink and i got a cool cup. They have cool bottles and a saxophone was really cool. I choose a simple one because i wanted to use it everyday and happy with it. If your looking for taste, come here.

The peach was super good - highly highly recommend - it tastes like the peach ring candies! The blue lemonade was a hit with my friends. The alcohol content seems quite low, I could barely taste it. It tasted really good, very sweet and the bottle is also very cute and fun to carry around. I didn't particularly like the way they put layers of 2 flavors because after the beginning everything just starts to melt together and it combines.  *Pro tip: you can ask to try the flavors!  Price: The price of our medium sized leg was about $25 - the larger leg is $35 and there are small ones for individuals for about under $20. For the price, it's not worth it. It's the gimmick of holding a large leg full of alcoholic slushies which is why people buy it. For that size, you could probably buy a slurpee at 711 and add your own alcohol and it would be less than $10.  Service: The service was okay - we asked to try all of the flavors, but he only let us try 4 of them. Not only that but I went with 3 other boys and he only gave us one little cup for all of us to share?? Not good impression at all. Other than that, the guy was pretty chill and nice - I just don't know why he was being so cheap with us sampling - we were going to buy it anyway, we just wanted to know what flavors we'd want.  Ambiance: The ambiance is ok - has a circus kind of feel since its brightly lit with lots of colors. It gives off a willy wonka kind of vibe. It might be fun to sit and drink, but I think most people just take their legs to go.", "Date": "2016-09-17", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Santana Ross", "ReviewID": "h9B6p1OzQnLYpmmrvCjypQ", "Overall": "3", "Content": "I loved the concept of being able to get alcoholic slurpees, because that is what it reminded me of.

A friend and I stopped in here after work during our visit to the Linq shopping area.  The place is set up like a giant candy store.  Actually, parts of it ARE an actual candy store.  There are plenty of little candies and such that go along with the rows of goofy, oversidzed glasses.  The back wall, however, is the main draw.  An entire wall devoted to drinks.  But here's the catch.  One half is alcoholic.  The other half is not.  So it's basically an all ages Icee/Slurpee stand.  And once you buy your selected cup (they do give discounts and punch cards to locals), you are allowed to step inside the gated area.  Now here's the kicker: They hand you a small collection of tiny cups to sample the various flavors, which I appreciated.  Nothing like spending a small fortune on one of those ridiculous drinks only to find that it tastes like Windex.  These tend to be more flavorful, despite the quantities of booze involved.  And you can even mix and match, so you can create your own Frankendrink.  So I friend and I walked out, giant zebra hooves in hand, and proceeded to have the rest of the night's adventure.  The staff was friendly, and the process was unobtrusive and easy, so it just made our stopover fun.  I've kept my hoof for the next time I decide to make my rounds over to the Purple Zebra.

The Purple Zebra is a haven for tourists. They have a large selection of glasses and containers, and an equally large selection of flavors. I wanted to go down to the Linq for the first time, and do the  touristy  thing.   I opted for a medium sized beer bottle shaped container. As expected, the prices were a bit outrageous. 35 dollars for myself and my wife, who got a small cupcake container and the non-alcoholic option.  I ended up getting a strawberry flavored drink, and mixed it with the mojito flavor. Not bad, really sweet, and not strong.   The pros- neat idea, lots of flavors, the female employees wear this tu-tu uniform, and you can see half of their back sides.   The cons- expensive, did not even get a buzz, gave up drinking after a good 20oz because it was too sweet, and not enough alcohol, you look like a tourist.

I was early for my show, so I said sure. Why not, lets give it a whirl. I walked in enticed by the color and fun and excitement this place exudes. It's ambiance and servicescape is a mimic of Sugar Factory and M&M world.   They have a variety of tumblers to choose from. I chose a Zebra print tumbler. I felt it was less like a yard stick (because yardsticks are more likely to be used to hold your loose change or be thrown away), and served more of a purpose in the long term. So, you buy the tumbler and if you want the alcoholic beverage it will total $20 (which they said a tumbler will contain 3 shots in itself). Without the alcohol and just a regular flavored slushie, it would be $16, and then refills with the container is $12.   You also get a stamp card in which you get the 5th refill for free. At least they have a nice incentive there for you to go back.  FOR THE OUT-OF-TOWNERS: If you are looking to try your first yardstick or first slush experience. I would recommend this place. It's more interactive, and customer driven. Think the 7-11 experience where you pick what flavors and the possiblities are endless, and there are free samples to try in case you're unsure. It's all just a world of choices, and if you're looking to have fun with it. Try it. This place was made for you.   If you brought kids with you, of course, they would have fun little cups for kids, and non alcoholic slushies so you and your kids can brain freeze together!

There were only about 10 people total.) So after a few minutes of waiting to see if they had any customer service skills, I asked one of the lady worker if I could see the tiny booklet with fun flavors written on it. She had no clue what I was talking about so she had to ask another worker (gentleman) and he had to ask a different lady worker to get me the booklet.  Are these people for real?!? Just talk to the customers (me!) about the flavors the store offers!! Sell me something.  I was there to buy a cup and put a yummy drink in it. Did they talk to me?!? NO! I was handed the stupid booklet and was still not asked if I would like to try anything. After the couple finished the samples and left (without buying anything) I stood around AGAIN to see if the worker (gentleman) would ask me if I would like a sample. (Mind you again....There was NO ONE around except me! Well my friends too but they were telling me to leave since we got no friendly worker to help us.) Getting annoyed by now I finally said that I would like to try the strawberry  something  (forgot the full name) and was given the tiniest sample in the world. It was probably one drop of the drink.  I noticed the couple before me getting their tiny sample cup filled to the top.  I was not asked if I liked the flavors or if I was interested in getting a cup....nope.  It was tasty and sugary but not a lot of alcohol.  I walked around and some of the prices were not labeled...well at least not the cup that I liked. I saw the prices for the other cups. I turned to ask any worker the price and suddenly there was no worker to be found who could assist me...  So in the end...I just walked out without buying anything.
