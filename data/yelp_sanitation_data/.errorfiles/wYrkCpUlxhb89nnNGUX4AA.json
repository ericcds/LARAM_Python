Like almost all new places, small plates. The items are well executed but could use some tweaking. If you order properly and get some noodles or something else as filling along with another item you'll be able to get a good ~$10 deal around lunch.   Shrimp Shumai - best item I had. A bit more substantial than in other locations with almost a curry flavor running through the wrapper. Shrimp were not rubbery, light and flavorful.   Chilled Soba noodles - served in a traditional bamboo platter, they don't cling to each other and are properly al dente.  Age Dashi Tofu - nice balance of savory tofu and a mild dashi.  Thai wings - Properly crispy, but could a little sweeter and spicier. Sauce needs to be amplified.   Char Shui egg rolls - the sweet pork works well with the well designed wrapper. The wrapper was crisp on the outside with a toothsome chew through to the filling. It was served with a hot mustard sauce. The combo worked, but could be enhanced. The problem is the mustard, it is hard to portion onto a bite. Perhaps combining it with warm honey?", "Date": "2015-01-04", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Belina", "ReviewID": "YEb0GKgyxWk8_t6dSwG8KA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Chicken Wings, especially the Thai ones, Squid Ink Rice and almost everything else is amazing!!!!

After reading many of the reviews and the photos on yelp, we had high hopes for this place. We ordered the   Kanpachi: sadly it did not smell fresh and the slices were a little bit too thick.  Octocargot: very interesting, very flavorful.  Duck jam: I wanted to like this so much, but was very disappointed. It was like liver pate, and  I was not sure if it's even duck meat at all!  Smoked kurobuta pork with Bao: pass, I don't even want to write about it  Bone marrow: very good presentation and very flavorful. Good portion.   Foie Rinds: I know the foie gras was probably sprinkled on but I couldn't  even see any of it. Even if it's in powdered form I would like to see some. This was just fried  pig skin with honey. I can get a bag at the market for couple bucks.   We wanted to order the A5 waygu beef on hot stone, they were out at 6 PM on a Sunday evening...   Fortunately some of the Kushiage was good. But I think it's more expensive than Raku at $3.95 each.   The only reason I gave three stars vs two was because of the excellent service by the male wait staff.

I found this place searching for a tapas place and saw it was Japanese tapas. So why not give it a try. I am so glad I did!! I went for my birthday on a Sunday night. We were the only patrons there but started to pick up by the middle of our meal. Slightly disappointed at first because they were out of all the uni dishes! Really wanted to try the squid ink and uni fried rice. We were there at 5 so took advantage of their happy hour specials.  Pork rinds with honey- how can pork rinds ever be bad? Good combination with salty, spicy, and sweet.  Brussel sports- they had a nice crunch too it. Flavors were clean and let the Brussels sprout flavor shine through   Japanese street corn- perfectly charred, seasoned well, really tasty   Tempura- standard tempura fare, but they used different veggies, not sure what I was eating for some of the tempura   Oxtail fried rice- good sized portion, not too salty, right amount of meat and egg  Yari ika squid- the squid melted in your mouth! Not too chewy, very fresh tasting, and the butter sauce was so good.  Bone marrow and milk toast- this dish alone would keep me coming back. So perfectly cooked, nice fatty meat that melts in your mouth. The toast was toasted just enough without being too crunchy when biting into it. Definitely must get this dish.  Smoke Kurobuta pulled pork- sweet and tangy flavor, the pork pulled apart easily  Octo-cargot - rich flavor with the butter/garlic/miso sauce, but the Pablo breadcrumbs overpowered the octopus   Writing this review and remembering all the food makes me want to go back again! Definitely try this place out!

Literally entire  specials  menu was crossed out.  We wanted to love this place but wasn't able to try more than half the things we wanted to because they were out.  Really? Friday night and being the first ones there (place was empty)?  We ordered anyways cuz we were already there but we were forced to order just anything to fill out stomachs.  The food was mediocre.  Seemed like they removed all the unique items from their previous menu which makes them much like other jap fusion places.  No octo-cargot, tiger prawn siu mai, whole fish and a bunch of skewers were removed.  Ran out of bone marrow, Waygu, scallops, oysters and essentially all the good stuff.  Food wise - uni scramble wasn't bad.  Wish the pork rinds had foie (as some pictured on Yelp.. It's now yuzu which is a bummer) and it was a little spicy.  A warning would have been nice.  Squid ink fried rice lacked flavor and So I mixed some uni scramble and japanese mushrooms with it (mushrooms  were one of the better dishes).  I shouldn't need to incorporate my own ideas to make a dish taste better.  Corn was a bit salty for my liking.  Skewers were good tho but very much like other yakitori places.  Also Some Yelp pics show squid at the top of the fried rice.. Now they mix it all in so you can't see it.  Seems like you don't get nearly as much as you used to.  Overall, appears like they're trying to cut cost.   In the end, food didn't taste bad but we had expectations and was a bit disappointed.  Just wish they would 1) stock up (We're not from Vegas so it's not easy for us to just come back another time) and 2) bring back all the unique stuff!

Let's start with the customer service. Our server Peter was very nice and remembered us from last time. He was very personable and gave us great recommendations. We ordered the octo-cargo which is broiled octopus served escargot style. It was delicious. The herb butter panko was flavorful. The next dish we ordered was the oxtail fried rice. The rice was seasoned well and the oxtail was very tender. Since it was happy hr I'm not leaving Inyo without ordering their wings! Omg I am inlove with the Japanese Tebasaki wings and the Thai chili nam pla! Amazing flavors!!! And the chicken had a perfect crunch to it. So Happy hr for wings is $3.00 for 4 wings! Such a steal.

We truly felt cheated, and unsatisfied when we left.   On the surface, the price of $25.95 for All You Can Eat, sounds like a reasonable value. However, after studying the Menu, I concluded that unless you were stoned, and had a terrible case of the  munchies , or just pigged out and added a couple of inches to your waist line, you could probably do better ordering ala carte.   We proceeded to order everything we would have ordered, as though we were doing the AYCE. The servers were polite and respectful. The place was packed; not one empty table. Then came the food. We began to realize that the magic of Christmas had come to an end.   The portions were very small, even for Tapas, the presentation was non existant, and the quality was on par with Popeye's or KFC.  My wife ordered the Kim Chie Fried Rice, a standard for any Korean eating establishment.  She is Korean and she was not pleased with the taste.   The skewers served were smaller portions than those served for appetizers at a Wedding.   We ordered enough stuff that we were both full when we finished. But we felt cheated. Yes, we were full, but we did not enjoy our meals.  For the record, our combined check was $32.00, almost $20 less than if we ordered ACYE.   Regardless of price, this was not a quality meal, and unless you are in the condition I mentioned above, this is not a good value for the money.

Started the meal with the Japanese Street Corn... Actually fairly decent but I'd take the real Mexican Street corn (elote) over this excuse any day.   With the corn we had the kurobuta sausage skewer or what should be called smoked frankfurter with a piss poor excuse for condiments... Some brown, green & red powder with  sea salt!    Next was my wife's tempura  udon . No lie, it was linguine, not the fat doughy udon noodles we're all used to. The broth taste like brown water, completely tasteless... The tempura coating was actually on point though.   Wow the snow crab fried rice. Next to the udon, worst dish of the night. Came with soft scrambled egg and the worst excuse for crab meat I've seen at a restaurant. Again, completely bland and tasteless!  The worse thing about this place though was the service. Took forever to get our drinks, food came out so slow I needed a new haircut by the time our meal was done. This place is on Eaters Top 38, and they should be ashamed of themselves, I don't know what inept child awarded them this status but they have seriously lost me respect.   Half of the menu was unavailable due to a  bad meat delivery.  The owner telling us,   we only serve the freshest food, so we had to send the meat back.  Yet they're still serving bulgogi that he claimed is marinated daily, chicken wings & foie gras (which was a joke too). Cmon guys...

Not that I didn't like them before but now, I've been going more often.  With that being said, I've tried many places that have selections similar to the ones Inyo has to offer.. and that puts them in a tough spot. That isn't to say that they aren't good.. but when compared to my other choices, Inyo probably wouldn't be my go to..  The venue itself isn't too hard to find but if you're not paying attention, you will definitely miss it. Inside, it's very spacious and clean. The decor is something that you wouldn't expect from the looks of the place outside. It wasn't busy and judging from the other reviews here, it doesn't sound like they're busy very often.  The food is average. I ordered a few skewers and the Korean and Thai flavors of chicken wings. Taste wise, the skewers were what you would expect, but the portion size is a little bit more than ichiza or izakaya cocokala. Unfortunately, that also ups the price of the skewers. I found it really nice that they offered different seasonings on the side for the skewers. The highlight of the meal for me was the chicken wings. Both of the styles that we ordered were crunchy and flavorful and they weren't drenched in sauce to the point where the wings became soggy. I'd definitely come back for the wings.  There were other entree options on the menu but nothing sounded good enough to order for the price that they were listed for.  Overall, I give Inyo 3.5.

The Inyo lettuce wrap isn't like your ordinary Pei Wei lettuce wrap that has been  Americanize , instead the wrap is leafy where making it a  wrap  easy and the selection they give you from Korean Style, Japanese to Thai is a great way to try different flavors.

One of Eater's top pics for 2015, Inyo delivers authentic, classic izakaya dishes along side new creations, in a fun atmosphere.  For classic dishes, the grilled sweet corn is outstanding.  Brushed with miso and butter then grilled before being sprinkled with spicy togarashi, the sweetness of the corn is amplified by the umami notes of the miso and bitter charred bits.  The grilled squid in soy butter is equally outstanding.  Tender squid whose oceanic sweetness is seemingly enjanced by the natural sweetness of the butter and saltiness of the soy.   Well prepared yakitori and robata yaki items.  All grilled naked or with a sweetened soy glaze and served with lemon and an assortment of salts (wasabi, shichimi and pink Himalayan).  One stick per order.  The blistered, crispy chicken skin, pork jowl, and juicy kurobuta pork belly were all very good.   For modern items, do not pass on the foie rinds.  Essentially pork rinds dusted with dried foie and togarashi.  Chicharone crack.  The Bone marrow with red miso and shaved bonito is also outstanding.  The stronger red miso balances the unctuous richness of the marrow.  Using milk toast as the vehicle to get it to the eagerly awaiting mouth, a brilliant idea.  Just try it.  Finally, all izakaya meals must end in rice.  The Snow crab fried rice is excellent. Short grain rice cooked with maitake mushroom and a soft scrambled egg.  Snow crab is mixed in at the last second to lend its flavor without being overcooked.  Something heavier?  The squid ink and uni fried rice is oceanic goodness at its best.  Basically rice cooked in squid ink and topped with a pile of uni.  Mix it together and enjoy.  Izakaya service, meaning things come when they are ready and it's your responsibility to flag down servers and order more.  One of the best izakaya experiences in Vegas.  Oh about the phone;  there are 1000 pics of the food on yelp already  I say.  Five minutes later,  bro, I think your friends on IG and FB can wait to see what you're eating  says another poker bud.

Really great concept!   I really enjoyed getting to try all types of skewers, soups, rice, and other small plates. On this occasion we tried tongue, calamari steaks, scallops, bacon wrapped asparagus, along with their Thai, Korean, and Japanese chicken wings.   All were good, but tongue was a little tough and chewy.   Some of my top favorites was their squid ink rice, crab rice, calamari, uni ramen, and in first place, their uni soft scramble egg toast, super delicious!  Another unique item is their 3 foot meat tower for an additional $4 per person.  We didn't try this on this occasion as it seemed to be too much for 2 people but will next time with friends.   The concept definitely needs some fine tuning though.  So they give you a check mark list where you make your selections and hand it over to your server.  This is great however we didn't get a good amount of our items we ordered.  I heard the same thing happening with other tables also so it is definitely a problem.  Since there is no suggestion box anywhere, I will use this platform in hopes they read yelp reviews.  Perhaps having a list that has a carbon copy so one goes to the kitchen and one stays with the table and then as the server delivers the items they can cross them off both lists, this in my opinion would make for a much more smoother dining experience and then my 4 stars could turn into more of a 5 star review.

However, $24.99 AYCE does provide decent value.  Their popular chicken wings done Thai, Japanese or Korean style remain unchanged, are still great, and a must order.   Uni Scrambled Egg  with a side of toast and topped with caviar was also a nice treat that entered the realm of luxurious breakfastness.  And in no surprise to anyone that knows me, I enjoyed everything that had to do with pork belly.      Throwing some  wow  factor into the mix, the initial order of 20 skewers brought out on a long wooden board was definitely that.  The 3 foot  signature king skewer  for a ridiculously low price of $3.99 consisting of flap, chicken thigh, pork belly and garlic sirloin is worth at least one order just for the slightly comical presentation.  I disliked that I was put to work in carving the meat and distributing it to my tablemates, but at least there's now concrete evidence that I would be the worst employee in the history of Brazilian steakhouses.    Biggest minuses were the eggplant skewers being served raw and unquestionably the worst chicken skin yakitori I've ever had.  That retailed for $3.99 a la carte and really, I should have been paid $3.99 to eat it.  I seriously miss all the delicious fish and chalkboard specials they used to have and would be happy to pay extra for those items if still available.

Inyo has a nice sleek and modern look to it...but it's simple as well. Lots of wood, some art on the walls, a specials board on the back, and a small hostess table is just about all you'll see here. I really like it.  Their menu on the hand, is far from small or simple. It is very much like a tapas style menu, and there's plenty to choose from. From fresh seafood and oysters to chicken wings, there's likely something for just about any appetite.   We started off with a few smaller appetizer like items, the Edamame, Bacon Scallop, Asparagus Bacon and Half Japanese Street Corn. Not being a huge fan of corn in general is probably a reason I wouldn't order their version again, but I did like the different flavor with the miso butter. The edamame was simple, not over-salted, and something I'd definitely order again. I'd like to try their garlic butter version as well. Their bacon on both the other dishes was a bit soft for my taste, so it didn't pair well with the scallop, but was okay for the asparagus.   Our next round of plates were the Shumai and Uni Udon. Both must-orders in my opinion. The udon noodles were cooked perfectly, there was a good amount of uni, and I liked the additional texture with the caviar. Even with it being an uni broth as well, the flavor was rich, but not overpowering. It's one of their  priciest  items, but it was a good size portion, and very worth it. The shumai was excellent as well. Good size dumplings, stuffed with plenty of shrimp and paired with this killer mustard sauce that really made the flavor pop.  From their specials board, we got an order of the Scallop Ceviche and Kanpachi. The Kanpachi was originally served with another type of sauce, but they had just ran out of a hamachi dish we planned to order. So instead they brought out the kanpachi with serrano and ponzu. It was one of my favorite dishes of the night. The fish was super fresh, the ponzu added just a little bit of sweetness and a small slice of serrano was perfect to spice it up. The scallop ceviche had excellent flavor as well, the scallop was fresh and I like that they do it a little different with fresh veggies like tomato and cucumber. I would have like to see it paired with some sort of chip or something for more crunchy texture though. Another two must try dishes if available.   Our last couple items were the Seafood Red Curry, and Japanese Tebasaki Wings. The curry had excellent flavor, and was a bigger portion than I expected. I thought the mussels were a tad overcooked, but everything else was perfect. The octopus was one of the better I've had, and the sauce was so good that our friend was pouring it over rice not to waste any of it's goodness. Their wings here are surprisingly spectacular. Twice fried for an extra crispy skin, but not even the slight bit of grease on them, and still moist on the inside. The flavor was great and the only thing even remotely negative would be towards myself for not ordering the 12 wing sampler to try all 3 flavors.  Even after having ordered basically all of their most  expensive  items, we only spent about $90. I would have liked to try their desserts, but I was just too full by then.   The service at Inyo is very good as well. Not but 10-20 minutes after we sat, the place was pretty much at capacity, and quoting wait times of 45+ minutes, but we never got neglected in the least. Our food came out fast, our drinks never empty and the waitress was very friendly.   Overall, a great experience. Here's my quick cheese-ball recap.

Also, the setting is very basic - kind of a Japanese minimal decor.   But the menu is magnificent: It offers a wide variety of mouth-watering tapas-style items, many of which are vegetarian.  I had the mushrooms, corn, potatoes, okra, eggplant, tomatoes and tofu accompanied by the signature selection of salt. They were all exquisite.  Also the seafood options are delicious.

The menu is small and it is categorized into a few sections: the skewers, small plates, and regular entrees. I highly recommend the vegetable small plates and ALL the skewers! It's not cheap but with such high quality food, you should expect to pay a bit more.   I highly recommend this place if you're in Chinatown area.

Then we had a young man serve us the rest of the night. He was polite, professional and knowledgeable.   FOOD Food was the reason for low rating. Upon receiving my zaru soba, I wondered if I got a kids meal. Or was it a sample? I know tapas are small dishes but portion was ridiculously small considering the price.   Enough about the portion, I ordered based on what my friendly server recommended. He said their chicken wings are top-seller. I got to try their Thai style one which had more kick to it from the lemongrass and herb, and also their Japanese style one which was made with sweet ginger soy. I personally enjoyed their Japanese style chicken wings.   In addition, I enjoyed their squid ink fried rice. It came with sea urchin and had a nice flavor to it. It does look a little intimidating though...looked like a burnt rice but trust me. It's the squid ink, and it is really flavorful.

There were 15 of us, and we agreed to try everything family style.  Facility:  very nice little restaurant in Chinatown that seats about 35 people. Very clean with traditional diner-like tables and chairs. No booths or bar. No beer yet either.   Service:  the owner, Peter, greeted me as I came in and immediately made me feel at home. There was almost always someone at our table, so they were on point for attentiveness. I would say most people at our table ordered 3 items, so that was at least 45 dishes, and they kept up well.   Food:  the presentation of all the food was very attractive, and most were little works of art. Kudos to the chef! Most dishes on the menu are a tapas style. This is really becoming popular around town.  I'm thinking it's wise to serve this way, because they can give you a small amount for double the price. Most dishes here were about 6-8 dollars and had about 4-8 bites. Some portions, like the rice or noodles were the biggest.   I ordered the  Sumomono , which besides the cucumber and sealed, had this really cool veggie that looked like glass noodles and crunched even better.  Then I got the  Mixed Tempura  which had two pieces of shrimp, 2 white sweet potatoes pieces, 2 okra slices (which were yummy!), a mushroom cap, and a piece of eggplant. All of these were good.  Lastly I ordered the  oxtail fried rice , and although the flavor was good, there was not very much oxtail in it. After three spoonfuls, and multiple pieces of mushroom tricking us, we finally found a small piece.   I tasted many items from other people's plates, and the table seemed to enjoy the wings and the kushi the most. The wings were cooked perfectly, however I really couldn't taste the difference between the 3 sauces. They need to add more sauce or boost the flavors. Most people at the table agreed.  The kushi must-mentions were the pork belly, tomato wrapped bacon, wagyu beef, and chicken skin, but all of them were good.  They really need to amp up their  spicy . Nothing on the menu we ordered that claimed to be spicy, was even a little bit spicy.   Overall:  I really enjoyed myself. Wonderful friends, good atmosphere, great service, and really good food.

My previous 2-star review was removed at the request of the  Yelp community . However, I can venture a guess that the Yelp community was actually the owner himself.   The owner private messaged me after I posted my 2-star review (not this one; the one that was deleted and you won't be able to find). He wanted to know why the 2-star and I took my time to reply - explaining why I rated his restaurant the way I did.   Since the  Yelp community  requested my previous non-compliance review be removed, I will explain to the  Yelp community  the justification of the 2-star rating based on the review guidelines.  We visited two Sundays ago.  Once we were seated and given our water, it took a while for the staff to return to take our order.  That's fine.   Between the two of us, we ordered the following:  Cod fish - two pieces of bite-size fish.  It was the highlight of our meal.  However, not the most bang for your buck.  Grilled squid - overpriced; it's the same type of grilled squid you get at other izakaya restaurants.  However, they put this ginger sauce on top and it really does not do the squid's justice.  Unnecessary.  Squid ink rice with uni - nothing spectacular.  It's basically risotto stirred with squid ink with a couple pieces of uni on top.  It was a tad too salty for my taste.  Nothing to write home about.  I have had squid ink pasta with uni at different restaurants in town that were not too salty but still has that seafood freshness.  This dish did not achieve that.   Thai flavor chicken wings - as far as flavors go, this was good.  If you like chicken wings, order these.   Okra and beef tongue skewers - nothing spectacular about okra skewers, but then again, I guess you shouldn't have too high of an expectation about okra skewers.  The beef tongues were actually thinly sliced tongue like at the korean bbq.  Not typical of izakaya, in my opinion.  They also drown these tongues in this sauce that completely overpowered the flavors of the tongues.  I've had better.  Also, as far as their skewers selection goes, it's very limited.  There were no gizzards, hearts or anything like that.  Keep that in mind if that's your cup of tea.   There were another squid dish we ordered, but I can't, for the life of me, remember what it was... Must not have been that memorable.   As far as service goes, the night we visited, there were only two people servicing the 4 tables.  The service was slower than we would like, but it's not a huge deal.   The decor of the restaurant is nice; the walls are hung with interesting paintings.    With that said, I feel there are other izakaya, or similarly themed restaurants, in town that offer better tasting food at a better price.  I personally would not recommend this restaurant simply because of that.  While I understand the owner's intention to maintain the 4 or 5 star rating of this restaurants, as a Yelp user, you might want to consider the validity of this restaurant's rating since it appears this business will do whatever they can to remove sub-standard reviews...    And I know what you're thinking, I am just writing this review to be spiteful.  However, the only reason for this review is to provide the TRUE Yelp community about my experience with this business.  And if I was to be spiteful, I would have given this second review a 1 star instead of maintaining my stand on the 2 star.   Think for yourself.

Over the approximately three hours we dined, we got to sample items from the menu.  I was going to go here myself but I was cautioned against this.  I was advised it was best to go with several people to sample more items and that was very sound advice.  There were some real winners in the 12 courses.  The smoked foie rinds--crispy togarashi rinds with yuzu honey and shaved smoked foie gras was completely addictive.  There was some Asian spice sprinkled on for a little heat.  I would never sit around the house eating pork rinds, but if these were here, I would.  Moving on, the beef carpaccio was quite good and the presentation was very good.  The think slices were topped with stilton bleu cheese and honey soy mustard seed along with micro greens.  The mustard seed and bleu cheese were touches that added beautifully to the dish.  Another winner was the drake duck jam served with rice crackers, bean sprouts, and basil.  The duck jam was thick and delicious.  I could have eaten the jam directly from the jar and skipped making a small cracker sandwich.  Continuing with the winners were the scallop  dynamite --live scallop, spinach and mushroom baked in a house masago sauce.  The only thing needed here was a spoon or some bread to finish off the wonderful masago sauce. Finishing off, the crispy whole fish and the whole squid were excellent.  I was not impressed with the octo-cargot.  The classic escargot topping was flavorful but the octopus was tough from being baked too long in the escargot dish.  There were some good flavors with the squid ink and uni fried rice but it would be a dish I wouldn't order.

I noticed they play a rather unnecessary spooled music which is something I would omit, for the elegance of the dishes is stimulation enough for the senses.

Inyo is like Ichiza but with different cuisines too, not just Japanese. The service was extremely quick and friendly. I particularly like the wings. Inyo has the best wings in Vegas hand down. The savory fish sauce with lime and herbs of the Thai wings is much to crave for. The spicy peppery Japanese wing is just as mouth watering.   I highly recommend to start out with the Carpaccio. The fish was tender super fresh and the flavor was just right. We also tried the Udon and Oxtail fried rice. They were both amazing.   The best part is most dishes are under $10.

All the tapas are amazingly fresh and perfectly seasoned.  Since everything is a epicurean delight...I will share a few of my personal favorites.  The street corn is crisp and sweet.  It is topped with a mouth watering miso butter.  Another exceptional starter is the garlic soy edamame.  The pods themselves are crisp never musty or undercooked.  Continuing on to the Korean style chicken wings.  A savory blend of sweet and sour topped with sesame seeds.  I will end on a dessert note.  The lychee ice cream is heavenly!

The restaurant doesn't have the best smell and there was a family dining in the corner that didn't seem excited about their food.  The mood in there was just kind of blah.   There was 1 server who welcomed us and told us we could  sit anywhere, except that table  (a large 8 top in the middle of the restaurant). We hesitated to stay even after choosing a table. The restaurant doesn't give the best impression. The decor isn't terrible, but something turns you off pretty quickly.  I was afraid we were going to be disappointed and wish we had gone somewhere else.  Despite our hesitation, we ordered a couple of dishes.    Since it's all tapas sized plates, we figured we didn't have much to lose. If the first dishes didn't impress, we would move on.   We started with the chicken wings & corn (which were both recommended by the server). The corn came out first smothered in delicious butter and seasoning...we were all so impressed we quickly ordered another round!  Bam!  Things are looking up!  The chicken wings came out next. Our server allowed us to split the order and try 2 different flavored wings.  We got the Tebasaki and the Thai chili wings.  Hands down, our favorite was the Tebasaki. The Thai one was just not my flavor preference but it wasn't bad.   With the first 2 dishes down (and with a round of applause), we decided to stay and order more! We ordered the fluke sashimi special (even with the confidence in staying here to finish dinner, I have to be honest and say I was weary that the fish would be up to par. We were NOT let down!). The fluke was tender, not fishy, and so good we fought over the last piece!    We also tried the Brussel sprouts, bacon wrapped enoki, steak skewers, and kurobuta sausage. The skewer dishes came with 3 types of dipping salts which were intriguing to me!  The wasabi salt was my favorite!   We thought about staying for dessert but ended up opting to go elsewhere.  Overall we were pretty impressed with Inyo!  I'm so glad we stayed!  We all ate TONS of food and it was about $75 including tip.  That's a little expensive for a family dinner (two adults, one child) but we had so many dishes, it didn't feel at all like it was a rip off.    I noticed they have a happy hour so we will definitely be checking that out soon so we can enjoy more street corn for less!  Haha!   Service was nothing to write about, but they didn't fail to fill our waters and they didn't seem at all annoyed that we ordered 1-2 dishes at a time over the course of our hour there. Lol.  I would give it 5 stars if the first impression/smell wasn't such a turn off and the bathroom setup wasn't so strange.  You have to walk past the expo counter to get to the bathroom and both times I walked past, the cooks were just sitting there talking and it was just very awkward.

Lengthy in size, though the kitchen itself is quite small, Inyo has dropped the  Asian Variety  naming since a first visit one year before and although easily lost amidst so much Spring Mountain Road  competition there is little doubt that the menu remains both unique and aggressive, a board of daily specials joining printed favorites to comprise the meal our group encountered Carte Blanche.  Garnering some accolades from the local media, most recently a glowing article in The Review-Journal, Inyo's dining area remains stark but tasteful and although the beeps and buzzes of overhead techno can play on nerves after a while the service certainly ups the ante on other nearby places, as to does the ingredient quality used.  Starting out with sweet sake plus a warm towel it was just past 7pm as the whole group was seated  that course number one arrived, and with all plating done family style several slices of tender kanpachi  immediately enlivened the palate beneath sliced peppers and light ponzu, the flavors no less impressive than that at places like Nobu while a follow-up of dry-aged Wagyu upped the intrigue significantly with Stilton adding a bit of funk mellowed by honey-glazed mustard seed, soy sauce, and diced chives.  Using the rich beef as a springboard to several more hearty plates, the focus here certainly not sushi and sashimi as some may assume, courses three and four presented crispy pig skins topped in shaved foie gras and confit duck, respectively, the makeshift 'pho' marred by not enough rice crackers for sharing while Pig Skins made believers out of those not particularly sold on the concept through the use of creamy liver helping meld sweet heat to smoke.  Again doing a disservice to diners by presenting Cherrywood smoked Kurobuta Pork with too few Bao to be tasted without overloading each steamed bun with meat, a sixth plate saw  Yum-Yum  Scallops given a substantial upgrade by using fresh Mollusks beneath a tangy sauce teaming with mushrooms, a bit of white rice dearly desired to assist with soaking up the flavors, but not provided as a rush to plate seven left little time to consider such things.  Wishing the  octo-cargot  would have been as well crafted as it was clever - the garlic, miso and breadcrumbs completely overwhelming broiled octopus that could have just as easily been snails, fish or even tofu - housemade shumai saw the menu once again righted, black tiger prawns lightly wrapped with great flavor even though many chose to eschew spicy mustard.  Next presenting tender, charred Yari Ika generously brushed in Soy Butter before offering a bowl of black rice that unfortunately saw little added by a tongue of uni, although great texture was imparted by small bits of scallop dispersed amongst the grains, savories were rounded out by a whole Sea Bass served with beautiful simplicity, the dessert crafted by Gelatology's Desyree Alberganti full of fun and creativity as salinity gave way to sweetness atop varied textures with a finish that was both light and refreshing.  Planning the menu over a month in advance with most of the items served on regular rotation, Chef Series #2 at Inyo Asian Restaurant was a great chance to take a look at what Gregg and Peter are trying to create, a whole lot of great stuff with even simple plates thrilling, though small issues in presentation indicate kinks that still need to be worked out.", "Date": "2016-03-16", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Kern", "ReviewID": "s-a6sKWAzBRcHJEmFGp0qA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "If you are sick of the touristy Vegas food, Kashiyaki Inoyo is a great place for something different.

Surprisingly we were the only ones in the restaurant. We started off with a salmon belly dish (forgot the name and didn't take a picture, we we're too hungry and devoured it!), toro and avocado (very good but I would of liked it more if the fish was colder).  -Uni udon- so good! I just wish it came in a bigger portion.  -Thai chili chicken wings- fail! I don't like how sour and sweet the wings was.  -Japanese style wings- it was ok. Nothing special but it was better than the Thai chili wings.  -Kakuni- braised for 5 hours and served with daikon. Also ok.  -Grilled shishito peppers- served with 3 different kinds of salt. They weren't that spicy so it was easy to eat.  -Oxtail fried rice- extremely salty! We sent it back and the server was very nice about it and we switched it out for crab fried rice.  -Crab fried rice- way better than the oxtail fried rice! We told the server to make sure they lighten up on the salt, so maybe that's why it tasted so much better. Haha  -Fried jumbo prawns- the prawns were huge! They were fried and served with a sour lime like dipping sauce. Didn't care for the sauce so I ate them as is. Not bad...but nothing special.  -Street corn on a cob- this was very good! Corn was chard and served with miso butter.  -Castilla cake with Mochi and green tea ice cream- the cake was very dry! Like it's old or been in the fridge for too long. The verity of Mochis were interesting... There was a red bean mochi, a brown sugar dusted mochi and another yellow mochi with some type of sweet filling. I wouldn't order this dessert again.   Overall I had a good experience and the server was very attentive and nice.

Everything was well prepared and seasoned beautifully.  The service was impeccable...the only thing missing was a nice cold beer but I'm told the liquor license is in progress.    I think a lot of people will consider their chicken wings to be the star.  We tried all three types and they were all fantastic.  My complaint with chicken wings is sometimes they are bland or have a one note seasoning.  Not these wings.  All of them had multiple things going on at once.  The thai ones,  in particular, had a nice flavor from the fish sauce and finished off with a good kick of heat.  The wings stayed crispy even with the sauces.  We also had the salmon belly tartare served in a sauce with some thin, crispy wafters.  A little dollop of caviar on top of the tartare finished it off.  Really good.  Fresh, tasty, and delicious.  We could have eaten 10 orders of that.  My friend on a paleo diet needed to eat too!  Inyo's skewers were delicious and well cooked.  They normally are marinated but the kitchen went out of their way to make here some skewers with just salt.  They were fantastic.  The tables next to us (20+ people) ordered something like 120 skewers and were loving it.    Oxtail fried rice was delicious.  I really like the pickled veggies they put in there.  Kept the richness of the oxtail from overpowering the dish and added much needed complexity to what is often a delicious but one note dish.  It's done right here.    Also had a good variety of their sashimi.  The fish was tender and beautiful and served with a sauce that was just perfect.  I'm not a fan of places that just serve sashimi with no seasonings - that's pretty bland.  Inyo's sauce highlighted the flavors of the fish.  I'm not exactly sure what was in it but I'd eat it all day.  We'll definitely be going back for more.  Their menu is pretty extensive for a restaurant of that size.  I was expecting quality to suffer but every single dish was just fantastic.  Highly recommended people go before it starts getting hard to get a table at night.

We were too full this time, but I can't wait to go back and try the crab fried rice.  While the ramen did not stand out (it was for the kids, though, and they liked it), everything else was very very good. Actually, my favorites were the street corn and the cauliflower. Simple yet unique preparation and delicious flavors. I could have probably eaten 3 dishes of those alone. Bonus that they were on the happy hour menu (3-6 every day, I think) and priced at ~$2 each. While I am not usually a big time fried chicken fan, the wings and kara age both also distinguished themselves with great flavors and crispy skin. The oysters were good and I appreciated the 3 sauces (thai salsa, asian cocktail sauce, and spicy ponzu) they were served with - again, just a little touch to set Inyo apart.  What made this a great outing for us was definitely the service. The manager (owner?) remembered me from a Yelp tip I left months ago about not having lunch service! Amazing! (BTW, they have lunch now) He was on the spot all evening with recommendations, orders, refills, etc. We love eating out with our kids, but they can sometimes be messy/accidentally knock over drinks/eat with their hands/etc. I felt like Inyo might be a little 'fancy' for them, but the manager was super friendly and helpful and made us feel very welcome.  On top of all the food, we had a really good sake sampler and a happy hour beer...total before tip ~$75.

The texture of the fish was amazing.  next was the street corn.  It was awesome, a very nice change to street corn.  the flavors were rich and a bit salty perfect with each bite.  The next items were the pork cheek and chicken thigh.  It was served with rock salt, curry salt, and togarashi.  and everything went well together. each bite of a chewy fatty pork cheek was fantastic.  the chicken thigh had a bit of a sweetness and it was quite good.  next came the peppers and the kaarage chicken.  The peppers were nice and soft, and had a nice spice and char to them they were very classic.  the kaarage was piping hot served with some Japanese mayo it was very nice.  lastly we had the pork belly as well as the wings.  The wing flavors were amazing, each quite different.  the thai wings had a nice fish sauce flavor as well as thai chili kick.  they were quite spicy but a good kind of spicy.  the Korean sauce was sweet and crispy, and the classic Japanese wings were a bit saltier with a hint of sweetness it was fantastic.  The pork belly melted in your mouth and serving daikon was a nice touch.  Overall everything was really good, I can't wait to take my friends here, this restaurant has become a gem in my eyes and I will be back!   Also the anime music was a nice touch.

I wouldn't go so far as to call it an Izakaya, but it did remind me of Ichiza and Kyara. Sometimes I go eat dinner and immediately after feel compelled or even obligated to like the place after spending X amount of money on dinner even if it wasn't that great. After months of waiting to try their much-hyped chicken wings I feel this is a must try spot in Las Vegas and thought it was money well spent.  The restaurant is small and hard to miss. The restaurant is modern and feels spacious. They could probably fit a couple of more tables in there but I liked the lay out they chose.   They have a good size menu specializing in oysters, chicken wings, seafood, quality beef, and a grill. I think the pricing was very fair.  I will say I highly recommend this place.  The staff was nice. We were served by two people: one male, one female, and both very nice/polite although seemingly a tad timid. They had a small staff but handled the 30ish diners smoothly. We didn't receive one of our items and it was taken off without hesitation. We received clean plates after a few rounds of sharing tapas. One of our items was also discounted as the item shrunk in the cooking process. All of these little notes really made the dinner special.  They have excellent food. They have Japanese, Korean, and Thai  tapas . The food was really good. We tried almost everything. The menu is split up with how it was prepared i.e. Roasted, cold, ect. I'd recommend the crab fried rice, the Japanese style street corn, and the chicken wings! Get all three flavors and pick your favorite- mine was the Korean.   Some other notable dishes that were good: the cold tofu, the roasted potatoes, the squid ink fried rice with uni, and the uni udon. A lot of their grilled stuff had unique glazes on them that made the meat even better. The spiny lobster, pork belly, and beef tongue really stood out.    Pricing was fair in my opinion. They had dishes as low as $3 and up to like $12 on their normal menu. One of the specials went up to $30. As with any tapas restaurant the bill can get high after sampling a lot.  Some advice to the restaurant is that it was a little hot in the space. That they had a full second page for drinks but didn't do any recommending. This could be huge for them. They have a lot of creative food and drinking is a huge part to dinner. I thought the dessert selection was pretty weak too, so that could use some sprucing up. A signature dessert to leave the diner on a high note would make a world of difference.  After checking out their menu I realized that there had been some changes, so I was a little disappointed that some of the amazing dishes I looked at on their yelp page weren't available.  I had a great experience at dinner the other night and can't wait to return.", "Date": "2015-09-11", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Bree", "ReviewID": "UUWmdWYCIwtX_p-4yLqtpA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Loved it!

But Inyo was pretty darn good. Folks were fairly mixed on whether they preferred the food there or Ichiza, having done Ichiza Wednesday and Inyo Friday. The vibe at Ichiza is way better; Inyo was dark and quiet, so we -- a table of 10 -- were definitely the rowdiest table in there, and we were on pretty good behavior. Everything we ate was good, though.   For sure, though, if you are looking for Asian tapas and don't want to wait an hour at Ichiza, Inyo is a good bet. $40pp out the door, and we overordered and had a bunch of large bottles of Sapporo, so priced very comparably to Ichiza (maybe 10% more expensive -- maybe).  Things we ate at Inyo:  * Crab fried rice * Japanese, Thai, and Korean chicken wings * Kara age * Mix tempura * Oshinko * Tako carpaccio * Edamame * Miso black cod * Char siu bao * Assorted kushi  * Char siu egg rolls * Chu-toro tartare * Maguro & avocado * Whole yari ika (squid) * (god damn you?) half Japanese sweet corn  I'm sure we also had some of the specials. I don't have anything bad to say about anything we ate. The whole squid I thought was pretty well-prepared, and I generally was a huge fan of the chu-toro tartare and the maguro/avocado mix. But I like raw fish quite a bit. I'd say everyone in our group really liked something different (one was the corn, another was the octopus carpaccio).  Anyway, it's a cool place to check out.

Happy hour is 3-6pm Tuesday through Sunday.  Garlic butter edamame $2.95 not on HH.  This was mainly for our kid because she could eat a pound of edamame herself.  Nice and buttery and TONS of minced garlic.  Thai Chile chicken wings $2.99 for 4 during HH: LOVED these.  I could smell the fish sauce.  Japanese sesame chicken wings $2.99 for 4 during HH:  I love toasted sesame, and the sauce was slightly sweet.  Both wing varieties were perfectly crisp.  What I love about them is that they were all  flats  and not drumettes.  Since this was HH, not sure if it's always like that, but I always prefer the flats to the drumettes.  Kushi (skewers): octopus, squid tentacles, asparagus, bacon tomato, wagyu beef, pork belly.  $1.95-5.95 per skewer, regular price not HH...comes with 4 types of tasting salts to use but I didn't need them at all.  Squid tentacles were my fav.  Could've done without the asparagus, as it was dry and had no distinguishing sauce or flavor besides grilled asparagus.  Japanese street corn half a cob sliced lengthwise, $1.99 HH.  Super flavorful.  Shumai $7.95 not on HH (tiger prawn dumplings).  I was lukewarm about this because everything else packed a very flavorful punch.  This was just average (or maybe because it was the last thing we ate, I was too full by then to really enjoy it).  Hubby got 2 or 3 beers that were on HH, I had 2 glasses of $9 per glass wine.  For all of this food and alcohol, it was only about $70.  We usually spend $100-200 on dinner and this was so enjoyable since it was small bites.  The fact that it's laid back in there makes it comfortable for us to bring our kid, too...plus she ate a bite of pretty much everything and liked it!

Let me start off by saying everything was AMAZING and the service was beyond my expectation. Jung is a wonderful host and if I did live... closer than 4 hours away I'd definitely be here every other day.   brace yourselves....I literally ordered the whole menu.. (not quite but almost)  Oysters: Was small and sweet, I think it was the weather and we all come from LA it wasn't our best but it wasn't as bad as ....the worry we went through hahaha it's FRESH.   Kanpachi, they didn't have kanpachi so they gave us hamachi, their micro cilantro is perfect with it.  Hirame: Fresh and this was a little surprising with the olives! wasn't expecting olive but it was a unique combination.   MARROW BONE: BOOM.MUST.GET. PLEASE.GET. IT. NOW. haha I loved the milk toast that came with it and the pickled onions definitely help balance the oil and richness of the bone marrow... this was one of my favorite.   Foie rinds: I can honestly go by without.. haha Not a fan of foie and not a fan of rinds... hahaha! But my friends enjoyed it. It was creative how they created this dish... it's not common.   Japanese street corn: one of my girlfriends love....corn. I mean she LOVES corn she decided it was a great idea and ordered THREE orders.. honestly it was a great idea... we killed it... IT WAS AMAZING. SO buttery SO savory the flavors really burst in your mouth. MOVE ASIDE ELOTE! hahha   So.... my attempt to stay away from anything that gets me bloated were these chicken wings.. they smelled delicious but I had to stay away because chicken wings usually make me bloated and I get indigestion easily ... and I HAD to go clubbing but my friends cleared the plate within 4 minutes not 5 . FOUR. but they did tell me ... STAY AWAY FROM THE CHILI GARNISH they almost died.  Asparagus bacon never can go wrong and the bacon is thick but crispy YUM.  ENOKI BACON. MY ALL TIME FAVORITE ANYWHERE I GO. The texture of the noki might be a little startling though   A5 wagyu.... Do you believe that meat can also ... melt in your mouth? Do you want to experience meat melting in your mouth? ..then WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR order a thousand of them (just kidding please start with one) but seriously .. it melts right off of your tongue.   Ox tail friend rice: we've been informed that the chef at blue ribbon is the chef here and if you have been to blue ribbon yall know, the ox tail fried rice is to die for... and it was equally exquisite here but .... my very korean taste buds needed sriracha.... ugh hahaha   Tempura udon: The noodles aren't the standard udon noodles, they are thinner and easier to eat. By this point we were way too full so... all 7 people shared on ... noodle soup hahah!!!   Alright so all my friends come from sushi restaurant backgrounds so we never order edamame but one of my friends did any way and it was the best decision ever, it's buttery and the garlic does not overwhelm the edamame.   I might be missing ... something but I think this is enough for you guys and if I ever do go back I'm coming here FIRST! They are going to have 30 new items on their menu soon...

It is a little disappointed when we saw the noodle, since they raised the price at 2016, for almost 10.00 for each dish, we expected bigger or at least normal portion, instead, we only saw half bowl of noodle n I was wondering where the other half went?! The bowl itself looks pretty though but too bad i am not eating the bowl n could not bring it with me... For sure you can barely say you are half full by ordering one dish, you have to order lot of foods there in order to be full. The corn n wings are alright, the taste are overrated, a bowl of crab rice they ask for 10.00 but i dont see a big pc of crab meat, basically it has little bit here n there that i have to search for it. I don't think it is worth it, mostly eggs, sorry to say that but if i pay 3.99 for a teriyaki bowl somewhere else it could be more fulfilling. I mean if they want to charge the price, they should give enough quality food out for the price they ask for, instead of giving out little bit food like a fine dining restaurant without fine dining luxury decoration setting.

This was an exceptionally pleasant surprise. This is a very thoughtful menu, I would probably try everything on it.   Great variety. There are hot and cold appetizers, skewers, rice dishes, noodles hot or cold and some nice soups that piqued my attention.  We had Japanese grilled corn as an appetizer. The secret is the miso butter which will now be put on every corn that touches my BBQ. We also had some nice oshinko to cleanse the palate. Very refreshing.  Had skewers of pork belly and cheek. The flavored salts were a perfect accompaniment. Of course we had all three chicken wings, as detailed later.  We will certainly be returning for happy hour. 75 cent wings. The wings are very excellent. Twice fried, crispy but not greasy, and all three flavors are distinct and complex. I like the Japanese style sesame ginger, but on any given day I could probably say the others. Beer and wings, what else could you need?  There are about 10 specials. We will try to get into those next time. They had a whole snapper plate and uni scramble that were intriguing had we not been so full.  Very nice service. They had good recommendations and seemed genuinely happy to have us visit and talk.

My group of 8 had made reservations for 9:30 and when we arrived they told us it would be another 15 minutes till our table would be ready. Reservations are made to ensure you can have a table so being told we had to wait made our mood go down quite quickly. So 15 minutes pass and we check and they completely ignore us until we give them a glare. Our 15 minute wait turned into a half hour wait and during that time, groups of people walk out talking about how  shitty  the place was. Instead of waiting even more for them to get the table ready we decided to eat somewhere else and as we leave the host comes out looking for us as if we weren't mad.

It's Asian tapas-so small plates which means you can try a lot!  Instead of fusion they picked dishes from Japanese,  Thai,  Chinese,  and Korean cuisine.    We ordered about a dozen things to try but before anything came out we were served a complimentary tasting of kim chee, daikon, and seasoned seaweed-all great.  The daikon was my favorite and it had a slight sesame flavor.    The edamame with garlic, shishito peppers, and vegetable tempura came out quickly. I would have been happy to double up on the three of those and call it a meal. The tempura was light and crispy and had a nice assortment including: mushroom,  okra, sweet potato,  squash,  and (specially requested) lotus root. The shishito peppers were lovely and had a small bit of katsuobushi (shaved dried fish) on top.   The grilled skewers were next-make sure to order the bacon wrapped tomatoes.  The bacon was more of a  pancetta and oh so tasty. We also had the okra and asparagus. Our server brought out three salts for dipping: sea,  curry,  and togarashi.   Chicken wings came out next: Thai and Korean - four to an order. Both had heat but the Thai were definitely hotter.  They were tasty and quite large, however I prefer smaller, trimmed wings.   Rounding out the meal was an order of pad thai and karaage. The chicken was battered and then fried. I'm used to a more intensely flavored batter but this was lightly seasoned.   Overall a great meal,  attentive server and clean interior.  This place is a must try.

We started with three plates and a few skewers, we figured we could add more, if necessary. It ended up being perfect for two.   The Mix Tempura ($6.95) was yummy. The veggies still had bite, the tempura batter was light and crisp without being greasy.   The Crab Fried Rice ($7.95) did not disappoint. It had great flavor and a nice portion of crab considering the reasonable price. We had plenty to share.  We tried three skewers: Asparagus bacon ($2.95), mushroom ($1.50), and eggplant ($1.95). They each had nice flavor from the grill. Light and tasty.  I heard many praises for wings so they were a must, even if I'm not fond of chicken on the bone. We opted for the mild version since my friend has an aversion to heat. The Japanese Tebasaki Chicken Wings ($4.95) were delicious. Perfectly crisp and juicy.

I have done a lot of research on top restaurants in Las Vegas and I remembered Inyo being one of the restaurants I've read about. It was also recommended to me by a fellow food lover at a restaurant I was dining at last summer. I felt confident about selecting Inyo for our tasting menu dinner party.  I called the owner, Peter, and asked if he would a tasting menu for our large group. He said that he has done tasting menus before and he would email me so we can work together to put a menu together within my budget.   We finally settled on a menu with a total cost of $42 including tax and tip.  The chef at Inyo Variety is Gregg Fortunato who previously had stints as executive chef at Little Buddha at Palms and Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill at the Cosmopolitan. He also opened up an Asian fusion restaurant at a hotel in Biloxi, Mississippi and has worked in the opening team at some locations of the upscale chain, Roy's Restaurant.   With his experience, what you're getting at Inyo is Las Vegas Strip world-class food at off-strip prices.   Inyo has been rated as one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas and I feel is still undiscovered since we were the only ones in the restaurant for the first couple hours.  $42 tasting menu:  Garlic soy butter edamame - Probably the most flavorful preparation of edamame I've ever had.  Japanese street corn - Next level elote. More satisfying than the street corner elote I had recently  Duck jam - Confit drake duck leg  pho flavor  with radish salad and crostini  Smoked foie rinds - Crispy togarashi pork rinds with yuzu honey & shaved smoked foie gras  Octo-cargot - Broiled spanish octopus baked escargot style with garlic, shiro miso and herb butter panko  Bone marrow - Roasted beef bone with truffle red miso, shaved bonito, fried herbs and milk toast  Cauliflower - Chile nam pla & mint  Brussel sprouts - Tosazu sauce & bonito  Wings 3 ways - Thai, Japanese, and Korean chicken wings all with their own very distinct flavor 1) Japanese tebasaki - sweet ginger soy & black pepper 2) Thai chili nam pla - chili, lemon grass, fresh herbs 3) Korean gochugaru - Korean chili flakes, sesame seeds  Yari ika squid - Grilled large imported sashimi grade squid w/ soy butter  Snow crab fried rice - Maitake & soft scrambled egg   Squid ink uni fried rice - Squid leg, usea urchin  Gelato - Green tea chocolate chip, red bean from local gelateria, Gelatology. I could have passed on the red bean flavor. It had a strong earthy flavor that I didn't enjoy too much and neither did my table mates.  We all could not believe we got so much food for $42!   There were more adventurous dishes in there that I wanted to throw in to make it a bit more interesting.   The presentation was beautiful and portions were just right. Peter threw in some new menu items for us to taste such as the octo-scargo and the dishes they are known for such as the wings and yari ika squid.  We all left extremely satisfied that evening.   Peter was really attentive ensure our waters were topped off. Great service despite managing our large party on his own.  It's located in Chinatown in a shopping center so there's plenty of parking.   There's a bottle charge if you're planning on bringing wine, but Peter told me that they have reasonable prices for bottles of wine at under $30. They also have the most interesting selection of Japanese craft beer.   To be honest, I enjoyed these inventive and playful dishes more than my meal at Raku at more than half the price. Yes, it's  fusion  which I typically don't like, but with an open mind, I was really pleased with the entire experience. Chef has described what he does is cook utilizing French technique using Asian ingredients.  As Eater Las Vegas mentioned --  run, don't walk  to Inyo Variety Restaurant. It's still a bit of an unknown spot serving some of the best tasting food in Las Vegas. Great for those willing to leave the strip for in my opinion a better taste of the Las Vegas culinary scene where the chefs and locals eat.", "Date": "2016-02-01", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Ashley", "ReviewID": "vcmlSPGbPgNqSEOCGwxUBw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Yowzers, this place was great!

Service is attentive, genuine, and personable, particularly from owner Peter. Interior is nicely appointed, really like the art on the walls.  TUNA TARTARE: $8, simple but super fresh and flavorful. Will be trying salmon version next. VEGGIE TEMPURA: $6, good mix of squash, okra, and pumpkin in a light batter with a flavorful dipping sauce.  SHUMAI: $6/4-piece, delicate and flavorful with shrimp inside, caviar and green onion on top. This place isn't about to compete with my favorite dim sum shop, but it's a well-executed version I'm happy to see (though it's not on the official menu yet).  CHICKEN WINGS- three varieties available, twice-fried for extra crispiness. Recommend getting the sampler to try all three, one of the better takeout options. JAPANESE TEBASAKI: with sweet ginger soy and black pepper, probably my favorite. Sweet and savory and a bit of spice, well balanced. THAI CHILE NAM PLA: chile, lemongrass, and fresh herbs. Great, flavorful simplicity, wish these had a bit of heat to them. KOREAN GOCHUGARU: korean chile flakes and sesame seeds bring great texture to another simple take on wings, did not expect to like these as much as I did. Not spicy, despite the use of chile flakes.  Currently BYOB. Pricing is fair, hours go late, great place for group dining shared tapas style.

What we had:  Green tea miso soup Japanese chicken wings (4 piece) Thai chicken wings (4 piece) Crab fried rice Vegetable tempura Steak skewers Saikoro steak Shrimp shumai Char siu egg rolls Castella cake  The most expensive item was the Saikoro steak at $9.95; most of the other dishes that we ordered ranged from $2-$6.   Definite winners were the Japanese chicken wings with ginger soy sauce and black pepper as well as the crab fried rice.  The steak skewers were good, but at $2.95 each, too small for us.  I also liked the shrimp shumai and vegetable tempura.  I didn't try the Thai chicken wings because the b/f ordered them towards the end of the meal and I wanted to save room for dessert.

First the bad, kara age was good and juicy, but not crispy on the outside. Try Fukumimi and you'll see what I'm talking about. The tempura was over battered. Tempura should be delicate.

So tasty! Should have ordered a dozen! But since all our food today is made from corn anyway (high fructose corn syrup), probably not a good idea. The salt and pepper shrimp was perfect.

What did I think of Inyo? After spending countless hours looking at the pictures on Yelp we finally made it here for our last meal before the baby came.   I had made reservations via Yelp. Thanks Yelp! We got there and there were a bunch of tables but they were dirty and two parties waiting. They cleaned up a table and we were seated before the other two parties since we had a reservation. It looked like there were only two people working the front of the house and I'm assuming one or two people in the kitchen. In that case, service was a bit slow for a Saturday night. It took awhile for us to order but we finally did.   We just started off with the mixed oysters and I really really enjoyed it but wish I could have had more!  Honestly though, the only dish that really stood out to me was the Uni udon. My obsession with Uni this pregnancy is ridiculous, but that was my favorite dish. Sure the skewers were good and the one thing I really didn't like at all was the salty potato dish...(forgot the actual name). It was overly salty and I just couldn't eat it.

I went to Inyo about three months ago. Our party of four were the only diners. Immediately, I'm thinking this is not a good sign. Empty restaurants worry me but the minimalist, clean restaurant with the colorful, Asian paintings on the walls drew me in to stay.  We ordered a bunch of tapas. The menu seemed mostly Japanese with very few Thai & Korean tapas. The tapas/entrées that I liked most in order are:  1. Uni udon with caviar - Uni and noodles in a rich, creamy, buttery broth. Yes, please!  2. Grilled squid with garlic soy butter. Squid was cooked right (soft & tender lol) & the garlic soy butter drizzled over the squid was amazing.   3. Japanese A5 Wagyu (tender, flavorful, meat that melts in your mouth). I can see why they charge an arm and a leg for Wagyu.  I would go back for those three dishes especially the uni udon with caviar. The only thing I thought was blah was the clam soup. Just a little bland for my taste.   I just hope Inyo is still there when I visit Vegas again. (My friends who I dined with went back two more times and mentioned the restaurant was empty).

The food was largely hit or miss and serving sizes are small (3)service is very friendly albeit forgetful at times (3.5)  value : for the price and seeing size, the good dishes are not enough to lure me back. (3).  We came in for their daily happy hour from 3-6pm. We ordered a serving each of their 3 different types of wings ($3/4 wings) , the shio potatoes($3.95), the roasted cauliflower($2.95), vegetable tempura ($3.95), the kara age ($4.95), and the Japanese street corn($1.95). During happy hour, this would have cost around $27 total pre-tax. This does not include the yuzu sorbets we each got with check-in through Yelp.   We started with the Japanese sweet corn which is only a half cobb of corn. It was pretty tasty with the togarashi and miso butter. The sweetness matched well with the saltiness of the miso and the mild hit of spice with the togarashi.   Second round, the roasted cauliflower and the shio potatoes. The shio potatoes were kind of a nouveau Asian fusion take on the baked potato except miniaturized. So you get mini Japanese potatoes, wasabi cream and green onions instead of fingerling potatoes, regular sour cream and chives.  The crusted salt on the potatoes were a little too heavy for my taste as the potatoes were rather small. The wasabi cream was also rather strong as well. I didn't feel like I needed to get this dish again. The roasted cauliflower was good -  loved the color,  crunch and the thai fish sauce/chili combination. Would order this again but the serving size is again small.   Kara age was below par. It was straight up traditional style. Although seasoned well, it was certainly not crispy enough and again portion size was exceptionally meager for the price. Would pass on this dish.   Vegetable tempura was again another traditional dish which was also kind of a disappointment. Comprised of a shiso leaf,  thin slice of eggplant, kabocha squash and Japanese yam, and one shishito pepper sliced in half,  the batter was unevenly coated (see pics) and too heavy for the small pieces of vegetables served. Pass on this.   Now for the trio of wings -  twice fried to give a good texture. The best one is by far the Korean gochugaru. My hubby, who normally eschews Korean flavored foods, also enjoyed this one the most.  There was a slightly fermented bean flavor (I think... In the best possible way) mixed in with the chili which made the dish. The Japanese styled tebasaki was rather one note (mostly the pepper and sweet soy) and pedestrian. The Thai chili nam pla was the spiciest of the bunch - it okay with the fish sauce and lime but I didn't feel like I needed to get it again.   Yuzu sorbet was very good. Loved the flavor of the yuzu and the texture was not too icy (nice and smooth). I think that was our favorite part of the meal.   Service was very friendly but overwhelmed by the full house. We didn't get our water after sitting until the first dish came out about 15 minutes after ordering. At that point we had to remind them that we had no water. In addition, our server forgot to add the tempura down but graciously took it off our check which was very nice of him.   Overall,  we usually gauge a joint's happy hour to see if we are willing to commit to a full priced meal. After consuming $27 worth of food, liking maybe 3 dishes and still feeling hungry? Uh....I think I may have to pass on this one. 3 stars.", "Date": "2015-07-26", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Annette", "ReviewID": "tRoqYSuun2ZvIxgKvdemeQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Excellent choice for tapas style Asian fusion food.

Sadly, this place did not fulfill that hunger and my friend's husband had to have McDonalds after and my husband made tacos at home.   To start, although there was only one other table present, the service we received was not very good. It took awhile for someone to seat us and the servers were mostly hiding in the back throughout our whole experience. We had to flag them down for water the moments they did reappear and remind them of items we ordered. Their iced green tea also was not very flavorful and very watered down compared to other restaurants. (Side note: over the summer, I went through an iced green tea phase and sampled a lot of what Vegas had to offer. Yojie's being the best and this place being at the bottom).   Although the menu looks very delicious, the value/quality/sizing/taste just didn't justify the pricing. We also did not receive the banchan that other people have spoken about in other reviews, maybe they don't do it all the time? The table had an array of wings, which no one found particularly flavorful. I had the salt and pepper shrimp, which I thought Wendy's Noodle Cafe and Big Wongs does better. Although the fried rice we ordered (both crab and wagyu) looked visually appealing, it just didn't have that comfort food/warming quality you get from fried rice (made me miss Rice Trax). The street corn was also nice to look at and had a good char, but it was rather small, even for a tapas place. The one thing I did appreciate that I don't think I could find anywhere else in Vegas is the uni scramble.   Summary: A lot of items here you can find cheaper and better (or at least dishes that feel very similar) at other restaurants in Vegas , e.g. Soho, Japaneiro, etc. Coupled with the bad service, I'm just not sure what the fuss is about. With their 4.5 star rating, they clearly have fans who have experienced better, so I would encourage others to try this place out, with the risk of feeling unsatisfied as you leave.", "Date": "2015-11-23", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Bryan", "ReviewID": "LIkh_BB68wE_fogv2IPNLw", "Overall": "4", "Content": "This is my first time here.

Not a lot of meat in both BUT it was very well executed. (4.5/5)  Chicken wings- I got all three flavors. the chicken was very well fried but flavor was a little lacking.  They were all very moist and tender but I would have put more sauce and or differentiated the flavors more.  They all blended in together for me.  (2.5/5)  Mix tempura- u can't really screw up tempura.  Well actually u can but theirs was pretty close to prefect. (5/5)  Korean Somen- it was good. I especially liked fresh veggies in it.  Gave the noodles good texture.  (4/5)  Pad thai and drunken noodles- first it was confusing because the servers kept on calling the drunken noodles pad thai.  Maybe they need to train the servers more.  The drunken noodles which are normally my fav...were salty....:( and both dishes did not taste like they are supposed to.  No tamarind flavor in the pad thai at all.  Disappointing.  They both needed major work.  (1.5/5)  Char siu egg roll- it was ok. It would have been better with a dipping sauce.

My fiance and I stopped in for happy hour because I kept seeing everyone raving about the chicken wings. How good can they really be? I mean it's just chicken wings. WRONG. They're AMAZING. I've never had chicken wings cooked to perfection like this. It is light, crispy, non-breaded, and so packed with flavor that I just never want it to end. My mouth waters every time I think about them.   We started off by ordering all 3 and my favorite surprisingly is the Thai Chili Nam Pla. The lemongrass and chili flavors really punches you in the mouth and I love it. And I usually really dislike lemony flavored things, but geezusss. The Japanese Tebasaki is a close second with the sweet ginger soy and black pepper flavor. And lastly, the Korean Gochugaru with the Korean chili flakes and sesame seeds. (packed with a bit of heat)  Japanese Street Corn - Another surprising delicacy. It's smothered with miso butter and togarashi and then grilled to perfection. The char adds a nice texture as well on the little bits of the corn.  Squid Ink & Uni Fried Rice - Garlic is prominent in the fried rice and it is so damn good. They even add pieces of squid in the mix and they are not stingy with the uni either. I believe they use Santa Barbara uni so it adds a nice hint of sweetness to the dish.  Bone Marrow - This will be my biased opinion because I've never had this before so I don't have anything to compare it to. But my god. The fatty, oily, goodness just soaks into the milk toast. Scoop a little of the truffle red miso and you are golden.  Yari Ika Squid - Where the hell have you been all my life? It's a gigantic grilled sashimi grade squid with an insane soy butter to compliment. After done with the squid, I was just using the sauce to dip all my skewers in after.  Smoked Kurobuta Pulled Pork - This was served with 3 bao's and a bottle of Kentuckyaki BBQ sauce. The pulled pork was marinated heavily and I wish there was a little more pork because I felt like the plainness of the bao cut the flavor out.  Now to the kushi skewers.  Okra - Definitely good but would not go out of my way to get this. Probably there to accommodate any vegetarians or picky people.  Chicken Skin - I don't know if they do the flash frying style again, then throw on the tare sauce, but good god, they are doing something right.  Beef Tongue, Pork Cheek and Kurobuta Pork Belly - Delicious, tender, fatty, flavorful, etc etc etc. These will be the death of me.  Come to find out, our server was Peter, the owner! Such a nice dude. He learned that we are freaks about uni so he let us sample the white chocolate Santa Barbara uni gelato that Desyree from Gelatology concocted. This flavor will be the dragon I will continually crave, chase and yearn for. I already knew she was talented. But what the hell? How does she come up with these ideas?  So to conclude.
