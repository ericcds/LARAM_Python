We stopped in to the restaurant to get some lunch. We had been to A Cut Above on several occasions. On this occasion, the restaurant was only about half full. The lobby of the hotel was packed with people trying to get warm. There was a long line of people waiting to get in to the restaurant. The hostess ran around the restaurant, frantic, although the place was only half full. A couple in front of me was told that the wait was 20 minutes. I inquired about the wait and said to the hostess that I couldn't understand why there was a long wait when there were so many open tables. She then told me that it would only be a 5-minute wait. She was very overwhelmed...why, I have no clue. You would think that with the snow, the restaurant would have a plan in place for an influx of people.  I have to say that this restaurant is becoming more and more shabby in appearance over time. My husband and I sat at a table with chairs that didn't match. The carpet and windows are dirty. Then our waiter appeared. He looked and acted like Lerch from the Addams Family. He had zero personality, provided terrible service and would come to our table, look at it, take things away without a word. It was very bizarre. The food was mediocre at best, definitely not worth the price.   I must add that a couple sat down at a table behind us shortly after we arrived. We shared the same strange waiter. Our food arrived and we were finished (in the span of about 50 minutes) and their food had not even arrived. To say that they were frustrated is an understatement.  Oh, and then there was the joy of getting the check. I asked Lerch for the bill and waited more than 15 minutes for it. Finally, when the manager walked by my table, I asked him for it. he brought it with a to-go pizza box. He held it out to me blankly and said,  Do you know how to put this box together? I have no clue.  Really????  A Cut Above, in my opinion, doesn't even begin to make the cut. The restaurant has so much wasted potential. I will not return and waste my time or money.", "Date": "2013-01-08", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "Su-rIwBadShvTZ-ssmwN6w", "Overall": "2", "Content": "The lodge itself is ridiculously beautiful, and if I was just reviewing that, it would be 5 stars, but the food was overpriced and just stunk :(  We stopped there after a family snow day, after seeing it a dozen times before and always wondering about it.  I got the Philly Cheese steak, which was very bland, and if I weren't so hungry playing in the snow with my family for a few hours before, I wouldn't have bothered smothering every bite in ketchup! One of our kids got the Mac and Cheese, which was homemade, not Kraft-in-a-box like most restaurants, and she wouldn't eat it.  Ever see an 8 year old turn away Mac and Cheese? We actually sent it back.  Our boys got cheeseburgers, which got the same treatment as my sandwich.  My love got chicken, which she said was OK. All in all, with a place that beautiful and relatively remote, they could certainly step up the food a few notches and make it a really memorable experience.  As it stands, we will probably not go back to eat there again. PS - The chairs were really uncomfortable at the table, you walk past giant, cushy chairs in the lobby and fireplace area, to seat you in flat, hard, wedding rental folding chairs.

That's all I could think of while I was here.  If I had been walking in out of curiosity alone, I would have turned back around before anyone would have had the chance to seat us.  The restaurant looked tired and worn and the people that were already eating there didn't look too happy.  So why did I stick around?  Well, I got a deal from KSHP AM 1400 and thought it would be nice to have breakfast up on Mt Charleston.  Unfortunately for me, I didn't check the reviews on Yelp beforehand, nor did I check my coupon- lunch and dinner only.  I could have waited until lunch, but I already psyched myself up to get some breakfast.  So I decided to stick this one out.  I ordered the waffle breakfast, my husband the pancakes.  They both came with scrambled eggs and seasoned potatoes on the side.  While we were waiting for our food, that's when I started to notice the  Restaurant Impossible -ness to this place.  The walls were repainted, but only from the floor to about 6 feet up.  The rest of the walls (which are actually pretty tall) were still the older color of paint.  I could see the paint difference where they removed light fixtures.  The carpet was very worn and the chairs were out of style.  The windows needed cleaned pretty badly.  I started to wonder how clean the kitchen was.  Robert Irvine would love this place.  As for the food, it wasn't great and it wasn't terrible.  Just some pretty standard waffles, pancakes, and eggs.  The potatoes were incredibly salty though, and that was the only  seasoning  I could taste on them.  For what you get, the food is overpriced.  Basically the place was ok.

Brought friends from Washington, DC. We were only people waiting to be seated - 2:00pm. No one to seat us. People waiting at front desk to pay. No one to take their money. Tables dirty, no one busing tables.   After 15 minutes we were seated after I cornered someone. Carpets filled with dirty food, french fries and more.  No wait staff present.  After 15 minutes I went to a waiter filling up salt & pepper shakers. He said he was going off duty. I asked him to find someone. Another 15 minutes and he comes back to take order. Had to talk 'slow' so he could take order.  Ordered  Siegel Mountain Burger  $13.95 (menu said Kobe beef). Was told it was named for the owner.  1 hour goes by, no food. I search for wait staff -- none to be seen, only one other table with people in restaurant.  Another 30 minutes goes by, I get up, hunt for anyone and inquire again.  Am told my well done  Kobe  burger accounts for the delay.  Finally food comes after 1.5 hours. We stayed because we had a chance to talk and catch up on old times.   This was no Kobe burger! Lettuce was white core pieces! A cheap bun, a load of french fries -- for $13.95. A Carl's Jr $6 burger is better.

I never have high expectations for a restaurant in an area with few alternate dining options.  No complaints about the service.  Our server was very pleasant.    We started with the FIlet Tips as an appetizer.  As you'd expect with filet, the meat was tender.  The meat wasn't really hot nor did it boast a lot of flavor, but the port wine sauce and the creamy horseradish helped fill that void.  All in all, not a bad dish, although it could benefit from a bit more creative plating as it was just a lot of meat on a white plate.    I played it safe and ordered the BBQ Kobe burger.  Though the meat was slightly undercooked, it was juicy and tender.  However, the bacon had a beef-jerky-like texture, as if it had been sitting under the heat lamp since breakfast.  It was tough to chew, so I removed all the bacon from the burger.  The fries tasted like they had been frozen, just lacking anything resembling freshness.    My girlfriend ordered the Chicken Angelo.  This wasn't a bad dish, but it wasn't great either.  The chicken was fine, but like the burger, I question the freshness of some of the ingredients used in the dish.  All in all, the meal wasn't horrible, but it definitely did not live up to it's name.  I considered the prices to be reasonable before we ate the meal.  After we dined there, I felt it was a bit overpriced.   We returned for breakfast and went with the standard bacon and eggs.  Totally diner style in quality and presentation.  I found the breakfast prices to be more reasonable.

Then another 10 minutes to actually get them. We had a look at the menu and everything was pretty overpriced, especially for a bunch of college kids.

No biggie - expected that to happen. Went on a Sunday to escape this ridiculous heat wave and hoped to get a little rain as well. The hosts were very courteous and accommodated my broken ankle situation, so that was nice. Everyone was really nice so they get an A+ on that. However, this place lack efficiency with its staff. Our waiter was a super nice guy, just really inefficient and somewhat socially awkward. He had a large group he was waiting on in addition to us but in a well-oiled machine of a restaurant, that means others might pitch in to help things run smoothly. There were several occasions that left my fiance and I with puzzled looks on our faces but I think that most significant part was when he brought our food and then asked if we needed anything else. We had asked for sides of mayo and ranch with our food and assumed he would forget it, so we asked again. First he brought out mayo packets...that's it. Then went back to get ranch cups, then when he brought those, he asked if we needed ketchup. I think anyone with a little experience or common sense would figure out how to bring all three at once instead of making 3 trips. In the end, I tipped him well because I did feel he was doing his best...just don't think this is the right line of work for the guy. As for the other aspects of the restaurant...food was at best mediocre. We ordered and shared the warm goat cheese/pita bread and the club sandwich. We preferred the goat cheese appetizer with the pesto and sun dried tomatoes. Not bad, could be better in some way I'm sure. The club sandwich was pretty much what you might expect at a Denny's or other low budget diner. The bread should have been more toasted. The fries are actually pretty tasty though. The decor is blah and doesn't bring anything to the table there. I read the comment about  Restaurant Impossible  and started laughing because that is EXACTLY what I was thinking when I was sitting there with my girl. Overall, if you are absolutely needing to eat because the kids are going nuts in the car or if you get pissy when you have low blood sugar, this place will do.

We wait another 20 minutes and right when we were getting ready to leave they called us....all of this to even sit down. Mind you the restaurant is more than half empty.

I expected to see paper plates but they used normal ones, moving on up. the waiter places my wife's meal in front of her then places the exact same thing in front of me. I notified him this is not what I ordered. 10 minutes later my pastrami was brought out Luke warm. we were given condiment bottles. one of mayo was unopened and had the plastic still around the cap, the freshest thing this place had to offer. the service is absolutely terrible, the food is mediocre at best...I don't understand what happened to this place or who is running it but it is terrible.   we showed amazing patience as I saw at least 5 other groups complain about being told it's a 10-15 minute wait as a default and waiting an hour. one lady even got up spoke with the manager and left.

DINNER: We wanted the  Mountain Meat Stew , which sounded great, it had wild boar & buffalo, but after ordering the waitress returned to inform us that they had run out.

Went for a one-night stay at the Resort on Mt. Charleston with one of the Valpak coupons.  Coupon included dinner (two entrees) and breakfast (also two choices) at the  A Cut Above  restaurant in the resort.     A Cut Above  is known as a steak house, but as my wife and I don't really eat meat, we looked for other options.  We chose the Almond Crusted Trout and the Atlantic Salmon as our two entrees.  Both were simply perfect!  Our salad was also fresh and tasty, and for dessert we had cheesecake with raspberry sauce.  Don't think we've ever had cheesecake so good in a restaurant, it showed no hint of having been previously frozen and melted in our mouths.  For breakfast next morning we had a Southwestern omelet and the blueberry pancakes.  Both servings were humongous, the omelet came with toast and seasoned potatoes, the blueberry pancakes were cooked perfectly and loaded with fresh berries.  Servings were large enough that we could have easily shared one or the other and still been satiated.    The serving staff was just right; attentive without being overly intrusive.  Prices were middle of the road, just about what you'd expect, we would go back in an instant!  Update 9/25/14:  I've taken my rating from five stars down to two....    We stayed at the Mt. Charleston resort again, and were looking forward to another excellent dining experience at  A Cut Above  but were let down.  We ordered a spinach salad, waitress came back to our table and said the spinach was no good.  Really?  A restaurant that can't deliver spinach salad?  We were offered the option of romaine or iceberg instead, opted for romaine, and received iceberg.  Sad.        Also as an appetizer chose the spinach artichoke dip, dip was good, but the flimsy chips were oily and weak and a poor delivery method for the dip.         Lastly, because there was NO background music playing, we ate in utter silence and were able to hear the other diners' conversations in total clarity, and were shocked to hear another patron ask for ice cream for dessert, only to be told there was no ice cream.

I can't give this place a better review other than 2 stars cause it was pretty bad. We were seated fairly quickly and given a table right under a vent. Instead of blowing out warm air it felt like the A\C instead. We noticed all the other people were seated at the opposite side of the room close to a fireplace.  How odd we get seated over here instead. Even with coats on and hat with gloves we were freezing. We asked the hostess if we could move closer to the fireplace. She did move us but it took like 15 minutes and there were many open tables.The waitress took our order and it took forever.  We ordered appetizer and a salad.  It took 35 minutes to get them. We noticed other tables had bread and butter on their tables yet we never were offered any. The waitress was apparently so busy with the only 4 other tables in there we couldn't even get her attention.  We ordered a burger and philly steak and the meat was so burnt on both it was black. My sister ordered salmon and the rice was mush. The turkey wrap had cheap quality turkey luncheon meat. She forgot the coleslaw my friend ordered. So I dont want to be totally mean to the waitress as she was the only server in the whole restaurant.  But the odd thing was we saw like 3 bussers walking around and talking. They were occasionally filling water glasses and that was it. So not one of them could have helped the waitress? Though the experience was not a pleasant one, I still tipped the waitress 15 percent and my friend who manages restaurants for a living gave her 20 percent. He said though the service was not great he didn't know if she was just having a bad night and it was also due to the the restaurant and hotel having bad management.

Trust me, I don't write reviews (I don't have time to) and I should have trusted my instincts to NOT eat the food (I usually do trust my instincts, I've watched  Restaurant Impossible  way too many times!!)  My fish & chips consisted of realllllly salty fries, mushy tarter sauce and one large piece of fish...wth??  I've never seen just one large piece of fish when ordering fish & chips.  But I was starving after doing a snowshoe hike and sometimes when you're hungry, you'll eat anything, then pay the price later lol.  The fish was obviously frozen and sort of gray looking, dipped in batter, and separated from the fish altogether...ick in hindsight about sums it up.    After waiting 40 minutes for a table, why I'm not sure, our server was sure to tell us that putting our 11 orders on separate checks vs. one check was going to take A LOT longer to get our food AND our checks.  Why couldn't he put our food order in to the cooks on ONE order and figure out the check later??  Sure enough, what took longer was the food getting to our table.  It appeared, that the kitchen had the orders done in a timely matter but the food sat and was served cold to everyone at our table.  The server kindly explained that what took longer was HIM entering the orders.  Then he didn't remember what anyone ordered.  Then he brought soy sauce instead of balsomic.  Not to mention half the table was done eating by the time the other half got their food.  And Kevin was probably their finest server on staff.
