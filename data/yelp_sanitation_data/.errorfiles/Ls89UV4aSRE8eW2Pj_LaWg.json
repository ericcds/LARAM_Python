We were all pleasantly surprised.  That may sound like a backhanded compliment, but from the outside, it sort of just looked like a place to eat.  It's a themed place attached to House of Blues, so I guess I sort of expected it to be like a Rainforest Cafe or a Hard Rock Cafe, both of which I avoid like the plague.  We really only gave this a try because we were there with the family and it seemed like a good place to grab breakfast before heading to the pool. We did a Monday morning breakfast there with a group of 5.  Everyone liked their meal.  I split the eggs Benedict and the mini-waffles with strawberries with my daughter and we each enjoyed both of them.  I don't normally order eggs Benedict at any place that isn't really high-end because hollandaise sauces can be all over the board, and a bad one can really wreck the meal.  But their's was light, with just enough lemon.  Not to tangy, not too bland.  My table mates also enjoyed pancakes, omelettes and skillet breakfasts.  Not a complaint from anyone.  Our server Bretani was excellent as well, checking back frequently and keeping waters and coffees topped off.

Ever since my days at Disney.  This was a hidden treasure that people would pass by and not even give a chance but I am telling you that their food is so good.  We got a great deal through Restaurant.com so we were able to try a lot of stuff.  It's Vegas baby!  One thing you should know about Restaurant.com coupons is that it may look like a great deal but you need to spend a certain amount to use the coupon.  Our particular coupon was $4 for $50 but you have to spend $100.  Not really a great deal when you think about it.  Back to the yummy food.  The drinks are so yummy.  All of their signature drinks come in either a House of Blues souvenir glass or a souvenir mason jar.  I have both.  Buyer beware though, I think they are super expensive.  They don't list the prices on the menu and I actually have never thought to look but they are somewhere in the range of $20-$30.  Don't quote me on it but def. watch out for that.  Everything is spicy here!  Even their Jalapeno Maple bread.  It's delicious but spicy!  We ordered so many things.  The cesar salad with steak, side of mac and cheese with bacon, bacon wrapped meatloaf and the key lime pie.  All delicious!  Seriously, you can't wrong with their food.  Especially as a quick snack or lunch.  It's just a fun place to hang out when you've lost all your money.  The music is so fun and the staff is so great.  Especially Star.  She was so nice.

My husband and I got some complimentary house drinks with a voucher and we watched a duo band. We had a good time watching the show, and we were excited for the main act, Michael Grimm.   The waiter we had a large nice man who was eager to serve us at first. He came to our tables and gave us the complimentary drinks within a few minutes of us sitting down. After receiving our drinks, the waiter asked suggested a few items on the menu. After telling him of my husband's seafood allergy, he at two points suggested items with shellfish. He seemed to get fed up raving about items that we could not eat, and said  well then you decide.  I think he did not understand that some people have allergies or he did not know the menu well enough to suggest items that weren't shellfish.   Anyways, we ended up taking a moment to discover the menu and ordered the basic jambalaya and gumbo. Surprising, he still asked if we wanted to add shrimp. I said the allergy comment again and he seemed to get annoyed. Anyways, we received our delicious shellfish free food and had a pleasant dinner.  I got a portion of my food to go. But for some reason, it took approximately 30 minutes from when we got our to go box to get our check. Maybe the waiter didn't want to pressure us to leave, but he could have asked us if that was the case.  I am giving the place 3 stars simply because of the awkward service. Waiters need to be trained on the menu and common allergies. He was a nice enough guy, but I seem room for improvement.

I don't remember exactly how much but it seemed like the shrimp plate was way overpriced for the amount of food.  The chicken wings were really tasty...but then again, it's chicken wings and you can find good chicken wings anywhere.  They put the chicken wings on top of some cole slaw.  The cole slaw was warm because of the wings which made it pretty unappetizing.  We each had some steaks.  I had the NY Strip and my friend had the Rib Eye.  It was good.  Tasted like steak.  Table next to us had some plate that looked like they breaded and fried an entire chicken.  It was pretty huge.  I was impressed.

It was served as an open-faced  sandwich stacked with lots of shrimp with a fried outer shell. The order also came with french fries, cole slaw, and very vinegary cucumbers. The portion size for this meal is enough for two. I don't really have much more to comment about the food since nothing really wowed me...it was just meh.   I'd say give this place a try just once if you are around the area, but don't go out of your way just to do so. The prices are a little high for the quality of food and it is pretty dim in there (I guess they are  going for that whole intimate feel).   Note: They have live music performances which is pretty cool so make sure you get seats where everyone can see the musician because they are going to CHARGE you an ENTERTAINMENT FEE regardless. They stuck us in a corner and were not aware of this fee so it was basically giving them free money. I have no idea why they wouldn't make all the seats and tables accessible to the stage, They also charge you for tip and some other stuff before hand so just be aware of it....", "Date": "2015-01-24", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Eric", "ReviewID": "Hv8ggNuRgvWm4r4SA_5vLw", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Who would have thought that a gem would exist in the overpriced world of Mandalay Bay.

We came here on Thursday to see a friend perform at local singer/songwriter night.  That part was awesome. The acoustics were great, our friend Eric Alesi performed great and even the next band sounded great.  As for the food, their jalepeno corn bread is excellent, not too spicy but with enough kick to keep you drinking :)  Their drinks come in a souvenier mug but are not outrageously priced.  The Peach drink was excellent.  We had the fried chicken which was well prepared and came with a thigh, drumstick, wing and breast with side of bacon mashed potatoes and coleslaw.  The coleslaw was the way I like it with very little if any liquid.  We also had the ahi salad.  The salad tasted great and we loved the dressing.  Only 4 pieces of Ahi though. A little disappointing for $16.99.  What keeps this place from the 5th star?  Despite the taste, the prices exceed the quality or quantity.  Also the service was just adequate.

Here's what we had: * Voodoo Shrimp - The house favorite, sautéed jumbo shrimp, simmered in an amber beer reduction on top of housemade jalapeño cornbread.   * Street Tacos - Three street style corn tortillas, green cabbage, fresh pico de gallo, roasted tomatillo salsa, Cotija cheese and avocado lime crème with shrimp;  * Applewood Bacon Wrapped Meatloaf - A delicious blend of savory flavors wrapped in applewood bacon and topped with our house made wild mushroom sauce, served with fresh vegetables and Red Rose garlic mashed potatoes;  * Jambalaya - Marinated chicken, white rice, andouille sausage, sweet peppers and roasted green onions in a spicy traditional jambalaya sauce  I don't know who developed the Voodoo Shrimp recipe, but they were working some magic back in that kitchen.  Moist cornbread with expertly cooked shrimp and a killer sauce.  Woo wee!  I think that I'm going start speaking Creole after tasting that dish.  My daughter Muff and one of my nieces asked to have shrimp in their tacos and the kitchen easily obliged.  (That's one advantage of going to a theme restaurant, they aim to please.  No chef driven nonsense where the dish has to remain  exactly  how they envisioned it.)  They were gracious enough to share several bites of their tacos and they were tasty.  I actually ordered the meatloaf and I can tell you that my leftovers were great cold the next day. What does that tell you?  It was great hot or cold and that's hard to beat with that yummy mushroom sauce. (I think that there was some form of sausage mixed into the loaf too that gave it an extra special touch.  Yum!)    My sister-in-law ordered the Jambalaya and she wasn't really pleased with it. (I try to avoid Jambalaya if it's not in New Orleans or a kitchen that I trust.)  She said that the tomato flavor was too overpowering and sharp.  My cousin thought the same thing on a prior visit.)  Overall, we had a really tasty meal and I was really surprised.  Additionally, a live band was there at the time and the music was rocking.  Yay us!  Kitschy, yes!  But enjoyable?  Also, emphatically yes!  This is a themed restaurant where you don't get the blues!  The blues are just in the name!", "Date": "2016-01-08", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Joshua", "ReviewID": "y4ZCLQDANMqbDsGH0dsG5w", "Overall": "4", "Content": "This is a great place to grab a bite while you're waiting for a concert at the House of Blues, since you're literally next door to the concert hall. The food is delicious, and the service is superb. The prices are a tad high for the portions, though that's at least consistent with the theory of a restaurant next to a concert hall in a hotel in Las Vegas, so it's not a huge surprise. I cannot recommend the sliders highly enough; they're fantastically delicious, and you can add on a couple extras if you're hungrier than the three or four or whatever's included by default for $9.99. The meatball ones were delightfully spiced--not overhot, just enough to make you feel it--and I probably ate more of them than I likely should've. I burned the calories off rocking out later in the evening, though, so it probably balanced out. The beer selection is only so-so, especially when it comes to drafts. For Guinness or anything microbrewed, you'll need to go to a bottle, which can rack up the cost quickly when you're talking a 12-ounce bottle for seven dollars instead of a sixteen-ounce pint for about the same, but the food's worth it. Just make sure you have something to wash it down with. The service was always great when we were in, though sometimes the cover bands they had playing weren't stellar. Maybe it's an unfair comparison from me, as I was there to see a professional band rocking their auditorium later that night and nothing was going to quite compare, but their Rockstar Karaoke where they have people sing in front of a live band was fun (or, alternatively, horrifying--after all, it *is* karaoke) to watch.
