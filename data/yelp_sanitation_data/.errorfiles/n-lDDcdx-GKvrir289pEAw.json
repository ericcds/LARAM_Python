The staff are young and friendly.  I have yet to venture beyond the Royal Shave ony because it's so darned delicious!  A huge cup of vanilla soft serve, covered in shaved ice, soaked in your choice of homemade, locally sourced fruit syrups, offered on a seasonal basis.  So far love the pineapple, strawberry and raspberry.  To top it off, the lather is this insanely yummy blend of fruit and condensed milk- I think.  Whatever it is, it's so dang good, that I'd spoon it off the grass (maybe:) if it fell off my ginourmous, reasonably priced ice cream.  No kidding, my daughter and I battle to get the last drop, especially the coconut, love love.  Folks here have a down to Earth sense of humor and offer random discounts for busting a move!  Love the life size jenga game and ladder ball they set up for customers to enjoy, and we do!

I don't usually seek out shaved ice or snow cone stands, as they tend to be pretty generic with artificially flavored syrups full of dyes and HFCS. Lather and Shave does shave ice with a twist, like a hipster mustache.  They make their own flavoring syrups using fresh fruit, cane sugar, and water. Processing over 100 pounds of mangos to make mango syrup takes dedication! I sampled at least five syrups and the quality stands out. The grape flavor caught my attention because it really tasted like Concord grapes. After learning that they use grapes grown by one of the owner's parents on a farm in Idaho, I ordered it with a Shave Butter Treatment, which means they add a drizzle of peanut butter sauce made from a powdered peanut butter called PB2.  There's enough fun and creative menu options to keep me coming back, and the location at Aliante's Dinosaur Park (as the locals call it) could not be better. The Fresh Shave adds mint to your fruit shave ice, The Gingah incorporates ginger syrup, and the Razor Burn will leave your face on fire with jalapeño syrup. The lathers are freshly-made whipped cream; vanilla and banana flavor were available on my visit. This refreshing frozen treat can become a decadent dessert with the addition of lather, ice cream, and condensed milk, if that's what you're in the mood for!", "Date": "2015-04-24", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jason", "ReviewID": "6jNkWsyIxaP7y7hyMMTnKg", "Overall": "4", "Content": "First, through the summer, they're open until 9:30, not 8:30 as listed on Yelp.  Good, but different than you probably expect. Therefore, your experience at this quirky, family run shop can vary *wildly* based on those expectations  The name is quirky and the descriptions are themed. Shave ice with a  lather  of freshly made whipped cream. Get it? OK, moving on...  Here's the deal with Lather and Shave: they make their flavors themselves from ACTUAL FRUIT. Therefore, it tastes (and in most cases, looks) like real fruit syrup with the emphasis on the fruit rather than the sugar.  For example, the blueberry flavor is purple and tastes like real blueberries. Blueberries aren't blue. (They should be called purpleberries.) If you're expecting the colors and flavors of a slush from Sonic or liquid Jolly Ranchers, you will NOT get that here. The owner actually told me that he's had people argue with him that  blueberry should be BLUE . Well, true, fake blueberry should be a fake blue with a fake blueberry flavor.  Lather and Shave is about as far from that as you can get. It is the natural flavor of the fruit. Now, based on your expectations, that can be good or bad.   You should note that they will bend over backwards (literally, forwards since they're reaching through the window) to make sure you're happy.  Our visit last night was a mixed bag, but overall good. We hope our experience will help you have a better one. We will definitely be back, armed with more knowledge. We arrived about 9pm, so they only had the banana lather left.  Example #1: My wife HATES banana flavoring. She initially didn't want it, but since it was the only option, we got it. Fantastic! It was like the meringue from a banana cream pie. Huge win here. Huge. We both loved it, especially with the graham cracker bits.  Example #2: My grandson selected lime. Did I mention that they use REAL fruit? Yeah, that was NOT a good choice for him. If you've ever thought  Hey, I love lemonade! That limeade looks great! Wha hhah haaat, just happened? , you'll understand his experience. The owners were more than happy to add some strawberry that helped tame the lime's tartness. Tyler wasn't exactly happy until he got to the ice cream at the bottom.  Example #3: They had rhubarb syrup last night. When have you ever seen that at a shave ice place? (or anywhere in Southern Nevada, for that matter) I love strawberry rhubarb pie, so I asked if I could try it. It was delicious, so I had a strawberry rhubarb  pie  shave ice. It was a bit light on the syrup, but there wasn't any color to it, so it could be hard to judge. They're happy to add more.  Example #4: My granddaughter's blueberry. Man, oh, man. That's awesome.  They give you a Boba-sized (-Tea, not -Fett) straw with which to drink the melty goodness at the bottom. Man-oh-man-oh-man, the blueberry mixed with the melted ice cream and shave ice was the best bit of the night.  I went back and had them add blueberry syrup to mine and my wife's triple berry. It really turned it from  decent  to  great !  Now, I can't say for sure that their syrups are any lower calorie than the mass produced ones with artificial flavors, but boy, it sure seems like they would be. None of us had that  Post Shave Ice Regret  feeling afterwards. We weren't hit with the  loaded down with sugar  feeling at all.  TL;DR - All natural flavors. Don't expect slushy flavorings. Lime is not for kids. Owners will work to make you happy.", "Date": "2015-06-17", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Nelson", "ReviewID": "J2TQqzTx8B-6t2ce0oeIsw", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Lather and Shave is NOT a place you go to get a shave, it's one of Vegas' many shave ice spots located up in Aliante. Although their ice is not as fine as to what I'm used to ( I shave ice'd well over 100 times, born and raised in the shave Ice capital) I do like their use of all-natural ingredients in their syrups and lathers which is simply flavored soft whipped cream.  Of all their selections I've tried, the Minion in me loves their Banana Cream Pie-Banana Syrup, Vanilla Ice Cream, and graham cracker bits topped with banana lather. The owners are great people, and their prices are very reasonable too. They even offer Pup Cups for your pooch as well. Dolce loved his Peanut Butter Pup Cup!

I heard about this place via Instagram from fellow Yelper Amanda M and I was excited to try, despite their location all the way across town from me. Since I'm never in the area, I figured it's worth visiting as many places as I possibly could while I was in the area.  Lather and Shave was the first stop on our outing to North Las Vegas and I have to say it was great. The flavors are made of all-natural ingredients and who doesn't love shave ice. I opted for the blackberry and pineapple flavors topped with vanilla lather, which is essentially their homemade whipped cream. I was tempted to add some spice, but wanted to err on the side of caution and not try something too spicy during my first visit.   The flavors were great. The pineapple overpowered the blackberry as I expected, so I'd likely only get the pineapple next time and try some razor rash on there for good measure. My friend tried the ginger spray and despite asking for more to be added after her first few tastes, she didn't get much of the ginger flavor. Since I'm not a huge fan of ginger, that didn't bother me, but she seemed disappointed, so that's something to keep in mind if you order.   They are located at the Dinosaur Park at the Aliante Discovery Park. It's a great location where kids and families congregate regularly. There are even several ice cream trucks that park in the same area. I wouldn't drive all the way across town for them all on their own, but if they were located anywhere near where I live, I'd be a regular customer this summer.   If you are in the area make this place a stop. The owners are really sweet and more than willing to talk to you about their vision for healthy shave ice. Grab a cup and sit by the lake to enjoy your all-natural dessert.", "Date": "2015-05-11", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Karlein", "ReviewID": "QcBeHM-KfGZQlMH1g3TI8Q", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Perfect spot right at Aliante Nature Park!

First the shaved ice is delicious.  Like, I will go to the gym EVERY DAY ALL SUMMER so I can eat one every night good!  Next, the syrups are crafted from real fruit that is steam juiced.  No red dye stained teeth after eating a strawberry ice.  No neon blue raspberry tongue.  Real fruit. Real sugar.  The unique flavor blends are out of this world.  In addition to the shaved the lather is a generous dollop of organic whipped cream flavored with banana syrup or vanilla. On my first visit  I ordered the Royal Shave with blackberry ice and vanilla lather.  It was so scrumptious I went back the next night with my daughter and her friend and ordered raspberry and pear, yes PEAR again with vanilla lather.  My daughter ordered strawberry and banana with banana lather.  Each was exceptionally flavored. The Lather and Shave Truck is located in the Aliante Nature Discover Park  the Dinosaur Park  which offers plenty of shady spots for sitting and lots of room for little kids to run around. Finally, the owners are such wonderful people.  They explained the process by which they make the syrups, came out of the truck to talk with us and other guests all the while whipping up these incredible concoctions.  In talking with them I found they are available to do events such as business picnics and school functions.  I think they would be a great addition to a summer wedding reception.  If you have not already found them, pay Lather and Shave a visit.

I tried shave ice a couple times previously and found it to be just OK and nothing that impressive. The syrups here at Lather and Shave they say are made from natural ingredients. I had the Razor Burn and it was terrible. It's shave ice with jalapeno syrup that according to other reviews was going leave my face on fire. Lies all lies. You pick another syrup to go with the jalapeno and I picked strawberry. The strawberry was too damn sweet and I only tasted maybe a very slight hint of jalapeno because I was trying so hard with my brain to find any sort of heat in this shave ice. I just tasted really sugary sweet strawberries and wasn't able to make much of a dent in what I had. They advertise a shave ice for dogs with peanut butter syrup. The peanut butter syrup is made from powder and my dog did not like it at all.

This is totally different from the typical sno-cone shack with thier crunchy ice and artificially flavored and colored syrups. These delightful treats use a shaved ice that is so finely shaved it litterally melts in your mouth. The flavors are made from real fruit - my favorite is a mix of strawberry, raspberry, and blackberry. No artifical flavors or colors.  But, what makes it over the top AH-MAZE-ING is the Royal Shave - which means vanilla bean ice-cream in the bottom and a sinfully delicious whipcream topping called  Lather . Seriously... I keep dreaming about my next fix...  The truck shave theme is fun - you can get a  razor burn  with jalepeno treatment (I really liked it!), or even a ginger punch with the Gangah Shave.   The medium is more than enough for me, but I can see springing for the large on a hot day when I'm really fixin' for a treat.   Most sno-cones you get to the end and go  meh... that was a little much...  but not with these babies - I always think  should I get another one??

Then I took a look and saw such refreshing looking pictures of the shave ice offered here and really wanted to try it out. With our fur baby Brownie in tow, we met up with other yelpers and their fur baby for some shave ice in the park. The truck was easy to spot and the girls working inside the truck were friendly. Priced range from $3.25 - $6 depending on what type of  shave treatment  you want. The syrups are made from scratch and are all natural.   I decided on a  Royal Shave Treatment  which means you get ice cream, lather, condensed milk and you can pick 1 or 2 syrups. I chose strawberry and banana syrup and for the lather I chose banana. Well. I didn't get any ice cream in mine! I was bummed because it was supposed to have it and it simply did not. Also the syrup was lacking compared to what the others I was with had in theirs. They do give you a spoon and a fat straw, so I enjoyed sucking what there was of the syrup  at the bottom and I really liked the banana lather a lot which they were generous with. The lack of syrup and not having the ice cream it should have left me just feeling so-so.   They do offer a  pup cup  that's only $1.50 for your fur babies. It's shave ice with peanut butter syrup. The price was just right and I appreciate them even having an option for dogs. With that said my Brownie loves peanut butter, but didn't want anything to do with her peanut butter pup cup. We tried and tried to give it to her and she could care less. That really surprised me because I have countless pictures of my dog eating snow up at Mt. Charleston and as I mentioned she loves peanut butter. After some time had gone by she licked her pup cup a couple times, but that was it. Our yelper friends dog had no problem enjoying his. My dog was more interested in the banana lather on mine probably because the texture reminded her of the puppuccino from Starbucks she loves so much.   Hubby had the  Razor Burn Treatment  and that had hits and misses. This shave is supposed to have jalapeno syrup plus another syrup of your choice. He had jalapeno and strawberry. I tasted nothing but strawberry and no jalapeno when I tried it. Hubby said he for sure tasted the strawberry syrup, but very little of the jalapeno. When the girl at the truck handed this one to us, she said if he wanted it hotter to just bring it back and they would add more. I appreciated her offer, but come on! If you are going to call it  razor burn  then make it burn! Hubby found the strawberry syrup overpowering and sweet and handed it off to me. I drank some of the syrup and personally really liked the strawberry syrup and found the taste to be very fresh. I just wish they put as much strawberry syrup in mine that they did his! I have seen the other pictures on yelp and they look colorful with syrup, so I'm not sure what was up with mine. I  might give them another try down the road however can't see coming back anytime soon.", "Date": "2015-06-12", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Zulett", "ReviewID": "_PLpjEFZNVpHtH9t6y5E7w", "Overall": "5", "Content": "You must have 10 of them...am not much of an shaved ice cream but this is a must have ...the coconut pineapple awww men super good it's a truck but don't let them full you... all fresh fruits they have many flavors or u could customized your very own ...am there  all summer that's for sure", "Date": "2015-06-11", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Allison", "ReviewID": "nZascIYYtw6zYRHJ0PSOcg", "Overall": "3", "Content": "First off the employees are super sweet! I love the concept and in theory it's awesome that everything is Fresh! The drawback to that is you don't get the same taste and flavors depending on how sweet the fruit is. I was super excited to try the Razor Burn but they sold out by the time I arrived. Being a fiend for everything spicy I will make my way back here and give it another try because I know I was a little bummed to arrive and not get what I was craving . We got one small Strawberry and one small Banana which I added peanut butter and chocolate lather on top . The strawberry tasted like fresh strawberries that just were not in season and desperately needed sugar! My son wouldn't eat it and I tried to trade with him and give this flavor and chance and it honestly ended up in the trash. The banana one was actually pretty good but such a mess .
