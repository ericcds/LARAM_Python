Unfortunately, if you go on their website, you can only purchase a kit with the same flavors, but I think if you call they can personalize it.

Up until this point I had never thought that making drinks could be an art in itself. Silly me.  Since I've heard their food menu is questionable, I've never tried it. Thus, this review is for the DRINKS seulement.   I've seen the ingredients they've used to make the drink menu here, and it's all high quality, each concoction made with care. The skills that go into each item is apparent in the fact that they put in quite a bit of alcohol in each (about three shots of liquor per average sized drink) and somehow they play in the taste of the alcohol and turn it into an actual flavor you enjoy. Note, the alcohol flavor isn't masked, only mused with in a way that benefits the overall palate.   If it's your first time there, try the  Sexual Chocolate.

Sugar Factory really stepped it up. Not only can you buy the famous Couture Pops and other candy, you can now by gelato, milkshakes, and crepes.   My favorite milkshake is called the cookie jar and has oreo cookie crumbles, chocolate pieces and caramel mixed in. So tasty and thick, they give you a thick straw to drink it.   My favorite crepe would have to be the bacon and swiss crepe. Melted swiss on the inside, crumbled bacon on top, served with greens and a very tasty vinegarette dressing.   The staff is very friendly and always ready to educate you on Couture Pops in case you are not familiar. Since my last review my collection, well combined with my boyfriend, of Couture pops has grown to 6 or 7. I love them so much and I love the food and dessert additions. I have yet to try the gelato.

Where else can you get a yummy bubblegum-flavored lollipop encrusted with sparkly crystals and a Hello Kitty charm?!   During my last trip to Las Vegas I noticed one of the lollipops in our mini-bar fridge in the hotel room at the Mirage. I had to find out where it came from! Luckily, the store was right in the casino. Sure,  it's expensive for candy, but money means nothing in Las Vegas, right?! I'd rather buy something I can bring home with me than lose my money in a slot machine or roulette table!  The guy that helped me was very knowledgeable and offered the option to customize any flavor to any stick. This came in handy as I wanted a Hello Kitty Couture Pop with Bubblegum flavor and it was the only one that wasn't out in a box already.  He put it together for me in the back and came out with it all wrapped up in its pretty little box. This made me very happy.  I also grabbed the blue raspberry 3-pack of refills after finding out this was their best-seller. I have yet to try them but the bubblegum was delicious! It was the best lollipop I ever had.

They are selling candy, not artwork. They should get rid of their some of their floor sales associates. Then lower the prices a little bit since they would reduce payroll and put up prices on their candy. Why should I have to ask someone how much is a jawbreaker or cupcake? It's candy. Don't think for a second that this candy is so good that anyone is willing to pay any price for it.   If the reason for not putting up prices is because they are high and people will be discouraged when they see them, then have reasonable pricing. Have they lost their minds? It's candy. CAN-DY. Asking for prices makes it a hassle type experience because of all the different inventory as opposed to an art gallery where people deal in thousands of dollars and pricing is negotiated. If they want more business and to not come across as arrogant, then fix your business model. Definitely not built for long term success.

After deciding against the ice cream I finally settled on their red velvet cupcake. My boyfriend came back with some chocolate covered peanuts and some peanut butter m&ms. The pb m&ms were the only good thing, and they didn't even make them. The red velvet cupcake was pretty awful. The frosting did not taste like cream cheese, just tons of sugar and no other flavor to balance. The cake itself was too dense but hard and not moist the way you want cupcakes to be.

The chocolate bar charges $2 a truffle, the Candy Store charges by the lb (~$0.87 a piece)  Candy Bar:   Some shirts were cute, they run VERY small. I generally wear a M, but here I'm an XL.

Seriously, I've had a problem with the Sugar Factory on the strip with customer service, and after visiting this location for the first time the other day, my hopes of better service crumbled, it's even worse here.  While the hostess was great and quick about seating us, we sat there for about 12 minutes before anyone even came over. Not only was the waitress slow, she seemed confused as to what tables she was suppose to be waiting. A moment after she left, another waiter came to take our order once again, and was confused that we had ordered with someone else already.  I usually get the veggie burger from Sugar Factory, not only is it really the only acceptable vegetarian dish on the menu, it's just delicious. I don't know whether they changed the recipe or the chef is an idiot, but the once signature purple bun was replaced with a regular white bun. Bummer. :(  Finishing touch to our horrible experience, the bartender that brought us our drinks was a complete bitch. We sat by the bar so I could see what they were doing. She was chatting with another bartender and seemed irritated that she had to work, you know, do her job, and make drinks. When she brought over the drinks you could tell she was in such a pissy mood because she couldn't concentrate enough to hold the drinks steady, she spilled a good portion of mine all over her hand and slammed the drinks on the table (further spilling my Cherry Pop drink) So now I have a drink with 1/2  of it spilled all over the table and she stomps off without an apology or cleaning up her mess.   Also, sticking the cherry tootsie pop in the drink is a great idea and all. But it would be better if they took the wrapper off and put the sucker in handle-up.More pleasant to hold and no one has to peel the wet paper off the candy.   As good as their sugary sweets are, the service and prices are enough to sour our mood. Stay away. FARRRR AWAYYYYYYY", "Date": "2014-01-21", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
