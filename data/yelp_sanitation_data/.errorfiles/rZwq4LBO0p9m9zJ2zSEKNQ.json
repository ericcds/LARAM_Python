Now mind you, living in the neighborhood, this is a regular place we have been going to for a long, long time. Sorry to say, Elements in Spring Valley on Rainbow, the other night your service was simply awful. The restaurant had just opened at 4. We were there for happy hour. There was no one there yet except myself and our friends. New manager ( i think) a complete meanie and just rude. When we came in , he abruptly snapped at us & said we couldnt sit at a certain place at the bar because a  regular  might come in.  At first, i thought he was joking. But he was not. REALLY??!! He made us feel unwanted and uncomfortable. Good job, fool. Is all i thought. What a horrible first impression this guy made!  WOW.  But we thought it was an oversight on his part and decided to stay anyway. Funny. The  regular  did come in, ordered one drink and left. But then, the clueless bartender never offered us a second round to our party and we were ready and wanting to eat & drink more. Oh, and the waitress roaming around the bar and restaurant??!!! Clueless. Knock knock...anyone home? Basically, we ordered one round of drinks, some apps ( food was awful), finished one drink each, and we sat, and sat and yes, sat, to not be offered another round because the three employees were just plain clueless to taking care of customers. We paid our bill and happily went else where. Keep in mind this is a little shabby place in a strip mall and certainly needs to maintain business or it will die.  When the old owners left, Elements went down the drain. There are a milllion places in Vegas so much better.  Service must be stellar or why bother. Plus...there was a weird moldy smell at the bar area........yuck. Some advice, & from the bad reviews here since new owners have taken over,  you NEED some advice!   TAKE A LESSON or CLASSES  IN HOW TO PROVIDE excellent customer service, bring back the high quality food like the previous owners served, and maybe, just maybe, youll make it. But if this is how you run your show, youll be closed and soon. 500 martini offerings in a dump, with rude service, is meaningless. Your bad business accumen outweighs the silly martini promo.

I came to this place for Happy Hours and dinners. Always a pleasure especially the dinner on Thursday, 12/26/2013. The holiday special: Surf and Turf (Tomahawk ribeye and king crabs) and lemon base seasoning sea bass WERE phenomenon!!    I therefore took my friend who loves fish and seafood here tonight and ordered the same things. I called before we arrived to make sure they still serve (Tomahawk ribeye and king crabs). Before I ordered, I confirmed with our server, Barry, for the sea bass. Barry told us sea bass is always on the menu.  I hate to say that, but the fish was chewy and definitely not sea bass. I showed Barry the picture I took last time as I am a Yelper and never skip the picture of good food. Barry was not attentive and told me next time just to show the picture first and the kitchen will make the same fish. -- If it's a dish always on the menu, why do the costumers need to show the picture to make sure getting the same food and quality??  The disaster hasn't ended. The steak was way too raw that we didn't even finish a quarter. The king crabs were warm in most of part but with dry and FROZEN part.   Our server, Barry, only had 3 tables at that time, and he spent 98% of his attention on one person of one of these 3 tables. After I reflected him about the fish and showed him the picture and after he witnessed the untouched steak, he just avoided my table!! Barry apparently doesn't care about the clients like the previous servers I met here before.  The only right thing for tonight is the food runner, RIGO, who is awesome, professional, and much more attentive than Barry. RIGO greeted every table he served, made sure the guests were satisfied, and RIGO was the only person who asked us about the untouched steak. -- Thumb up for RIGO!!    I am not going back to this place no matter how much I lovED it when there is no consistency of food and welcoming service.

The bar was packed with people drinking all the different styles of Martinis offered. A band was setting up to perform in the corner of an already crowded space. Was lucky enough to get out of there before the deafening performance started. Performer had a great voice just based on the warm up rehearsal. Well onto the food. Started with the calamari that tasted a bit mushy. Was slightly undercooked and extremely salty. I paid for that later on that night when my tongue was swollen. The two dipping sauces were less than desirable. The prime cut steak was suggested to us over the filet mignon by the waitress saying it was very tender and twice the size. The size thing was correct, but the tender part was wrong. Also had the spaghetti bolognese. This dish was good, but also loaded with salt. Service was friendly and suggestions were offered.

The restaurant is very small with mostly bar service and just enough tables for the week day crowd. The service was excellent. The menu provides an able selection including duck, to my surprise.

I'm put off by the owner and sadly disappointed that each of us tipped our not so great server nearly ten dollars apiece. The food is good and the martinis are decent though not spectacular.

If you are a Martini drinker, this is the place to be, screw Blue Martini. The Martini menu is insane, you can choose from a list of gin, vodka, rum, tequila or bourbon martinis. Each are moderately priced at $9-$11 and are 1/2 off during their happy hour from 5 p.m. to 6:30 p.m.  The food wasn't too bad either. We ordered a variety of dishes to be able to give a fair review. They do provide complimentary bread with butter and a very interesting sauce that tasted like it was made of maple, curry and something else. The bread is made in house and was tasty for a rosemary sourdough loaf. Apparently the bread changes daily.  Appetizer - the lollipop lamb chops. Honestly they were pretty good. Three small chops served on top of lentils with a cranberries and a wine reduction.  The chops were perfectly seasoned and not bad for a appetizer size.Also got an ordered of samosas. They bring you two samosas over a bed of salad. The samosas weren't bad but it was a little to mushy for me, I like my samosas crispy!  Entree - we ordered that night's special which was a wild mushroom, chicken, shrimp risotto and house salad with pomegrante dressing. Overall the risotto wasn't bad but the chicken was a little dry and having those three items was a little too much in my opinion that it was just a plain ole risotto.   Dessert - all desserts are made daily and changes out. This night we ordered a red velvet cake. It was very soft and moist but for some reason it reminded me of an Albertson's cake. I thought it was still good and the cream cheese frosting wasn't too sweet so I didn't feel too guilty for eating it.   This is a great little intimate place to go on a date or just have a good night out with friends. I would recommend making reservations since the place is quite small. My only complaint is that I felt it did take a while to get our food and drinks. Maybe they didn't think we would realize after our 2nd martini! However, I would like to try to try this place again, hopefully they extend their happy hour or stay open longer since they operate from to 5 to 9:30/10 p.m. Definitely a great place for Martinis!

When we entered the restaurant, Liz greeted us enthusiastically and asked where we'd like to sit. There was about 8 other people in the restaurant, 6 at the bar and 2 at a table in the corner, we opted to sit at the bar.  It's a tiny spot, but it had the right amount of space to get you involved with the other patrons and the bartender, who was awesome but I'll get to that later.  Liz handed us the martini menu and boy was it extensive!  Over 550 ways to make a martini,  listed in alphabetical order and by what alcohol is used (Gin, Vodka or bourbon). It was so hard to decide but I opted for a Chocolate God (tasted like spicy cake, which sounds weird but it worked with my meal), and my dinner buddy opted to get their little 3 drink deal (Absolutely Ruby, Rising Sun, and Antifreeze (which was to die for).  For dinner, I ordered the Lizs Penne a la vodka and my friend ordered the California Chicken. Both were made exceptionally well, with my pasta having just the right amount of vodka sauce and my friends veggies were crisp, the rice the perfect texture and the chicken crispy, but juicy.  For dessert, we opted to share the creme brulee which wasn't too sweet and came with a nice side of fruit.  Oh a side note, the martinis are on the strong side (or maybe I'm just a light drinker), because I ended up knocking over my glass and breaking it to which the bartender responded in a sing song voice:  blame it on the alcohol  and the room laughed.

He seems stressed. I whisper to my BF that maybe he'd just been yelled at or perhaps the owner threatened to chop his head off.  The martini menu is probably 7 or 8pt font size and the headings are brown on beige. If you are older than 30, it's most likely entirely illegible. It made me a little bit cranky. Common sense says.....make your menu readable. I walked it to a brighter area and picked a martini that ended up tasting a bit like a gym locker. $10 too. :-(  We came for tapas but the closest thing was under  Appetizers.  Again, brown on beige but at least the font size was a bit bigger. But I bet my parents would have a hard time reading the menu.  The food ranged from ok to really good and maybe even awesome.

I would have given this place 6 stars with the old owners José Luis & Catherine.   Bread came out cold, with a subpar marmalade. That doesn't set the tone right for dinner, however I was giving them the benefit of the doubt. I heard the  Chef's special  described, without mention of any price & I opted for the lobster ravioli. I was assured it would be a good choice from the server. My Partner in Crime ordered the Chilean Sea Bass.   Food comes out... Disappointed already with the outrageously small portions relative to the price (the lobster ravioli was roughly $22 & the sea bass was $32). So, as the dish is laid out in front of me, I'm thinking,  this better explode with flavor in my mouth.  It didn't. The lobster ravioli was okay, I wouldn't pay more than $10 for it. The Chilean sea bass wasn't good either. A bit dry and flavorless. Chilean sea bass is typically an excellent choice, but the sauce that accompanied this dish wasn't anything to write home about.   Lastly, the wonderful and passion derived dessert program Catherine created is gone. No more chefs tasting option nor are the wonderful made-from-scratch creations. They don't even have a dessert menu. Me and the PIC ended up going to grimaldis for their cheesecake.   This place gets 2 stars only because of the new  martini flights  they offer. I had been here about three times before they switched owners. Sadly, I won't be back. Check came out to $90 (including 20% tip) and the experience was nothing special.

It wasn't too busy when we arrived but by the time we left at around 8 p.m., it was almost full.   The maritni list is HUGE! Seriously, I could have spent an hour reading all of the different maritini's. I started off with a Samurai, which was gin, midori and peach snapps. Yummy and super sweet if you like the sugary drinks. The next one I had was the Lychee martini, much more subdued with vodka and lychee puree. I finished of with a cucumber martini which was amazing and refreshing, also a vodka martini. They also had rum martinis, which we didn't try and scotch and wiskey martinis. My husband had a scotch martini, which he said was good, but he still prefers his scotch on the rocks. So the waiter then suggested a new scotch they had in for the scotch tasting dinner which my husband LOVED.   On to the food. They brought out bread to start with, homemade white bread and foccacia, with fresh butter shaped into roses and a mango chutney which was very very good.   We ordered four *thats right folks* four appetizers to begin with. We had the short ribs over gorgonzola polenta, the calamari, the bruschetta of the day which was topped with escargot and pesto, and the fire and ice shrimp and scallops.   Short ribs: Cooked to perfection, the meat was so tender and the polenta had a nice sweetness and the dish was topped with a balsamic reduction.  The calamari was good, standard, nothing to write home about. It comes with a delicious sauce though.    The fire and ice shrimp and scallops: Both cooked perfectly and the sauce was seriously to die for, we were slopping it up with the bread. And they removed the tail from the shrimp for you so you dont have to worry about that.   Bruschetta: More of the yummy bread toasted with a homemade pesto that was nice and thick and not oily mixed with escargot.This was my first try of escargot and I thought it was delicious.  We ordered the sea bass to split for an entree. OMG. This was honestly the best fish I have ever had. It was crusted with seasame and topped with a citrus ponzu. It melted like butter and exploded with flavor in my mouth. YES! It was served with a side of mashed yukon golds and a vegetable medly.   The owner is the chef and his wife, also the owner, is the pastry chef. She came out and explained all the deserts to us and said she changes them up regularly. She also explained how she doesnt like to use a lot fo refined sugar and like to use things like raisins and fruit to sweeten things.

We walked into a small and nicely appointed dining room and were immediately greeted by the pastry chef and owner Catherine.  Both the restaurant and Catherine had a warm, welcoming and relaxed vibe.  We opted for a table outside and perused the menu.  We each started with the Maple Leaf Farms Sliced Duck Breast Salad, with wood grilled duck breast, mixed greens, caramelized walnuts, gorgonzola crumbles and pomegranate vinaigrette.  It was a perfect balance between sweet, savory and acid flavors.  I could have eaten it all night.    We then went on to the Lollipop Lamb Chops, pounded, wood grilled lamb chops, in a port wine reduction, with dried cranberries, and an english mustard sauce over lentils.  The chops were tender, juicy and perfectly cooked and the sauce was amazing.    Catherine read us the desert specials; we were sold on the strawberry apple pie with caramel and cinnamon and the plain crème brulee.  The combination of apples and strawberries was a wonderful and perfectly not too sweet surprise.  The crème brulee was just as it should be; sweet, crispy sugar on top and silky smooth cream underneath.  We also ordered espresso, which was the best I've had in years.

Intimate, slightly upscale but with a funky edge making it very welcoming.  The music was at a perfect volume as was the chatter of other customers.  My hubby noticed that in particular as some places you can barely hear yourself over the music!   The server told us about the specials and was helpful in advising me on some martini's that would fit my taste.   I went with the Prickly Pear which was sublime!  We ordered the bruchetta with mushrooms.  We \were also served some of their yummy home baked bread with butter & chutney.  That chutney was YUMMY!  The bruchetta was late in coming but the server apologized realizing she forgot to put the order in.  It was worth the wait though.    My husband ordered the Lobster Ravioli which he loved!  I had the Portobello  ravioli with a curry sauce. Oh. My. God.  I wanted to lick the sauce off my plate!

Steer clear of the middle tables if possible, you'll be literally sitting next to a stranger at their table just inches from yours.  Service; Always A+. The bartenders are friendly, knowledgable & quick to suggest a martini from the list. The owners are always present & accommodating. There's no question they are vested in their business & the happiness of their guests. Catherine will undoubtedly come to your table and tease you with her low sugar (but you'd never know it) desserts.  Food; Start with a martini-my favorite, Scooby Snack. They serve complimentary bread with a butter chutney jelly that's D-lish! Hubby & I come often & we've tried just about everything. Our favorites are pork oso boco, jambalaya, Chilean sea-bass, the steak. The portions are just right and the cost is around $20 a plate.

Not only do they have 400 different martinis to try out but they also keep track of the ones via customer card that you've tried before.  Let's be honest.  Who really remembers the quality of their martini after the 3rd one anyways?  $2 off all martinis and appetizers during happy hour (5pm-6:30pm) is a terrific reason to stay a while.    Walking into Elements reminds me of some of the restaurants located in Brooklyn, NY of all places.  The close but comfortable atmosphere with the new cabin type look would totally fit in and thrive on Smith St or on Atlantic Ave.  Just ignore the fact you can see the Terrible Herbst gas station from the north side windows :P      My wife got the  Jumbo Shrimp Marnier : shrimp wrapped in prosciutto di parma, Thai basil, orange juice, Grand Marnier, served on a bed of greens.  That was really done well and we both felt the shrimp almost had a lobstery quality of taste to it.  I can't remember the last time we had shrimp cooked with Grand Marnier so that was the biggest reason.  I might have to give this a whirl at home.  I got the  Prince Edward Island Mussels : sauteed with coconut milk, yellow masala curry, fennel, basil and white wine.  Mother of god!  Amazing!  The sauce was so out of this world that I asked to box it so I could figure out some way to eat it later (ended up having it with pasta which was great).  I hadn't eaten mussels in quite a while and this reminded why I should more often.  Curry and mussels were a magnificent combination!  They don't call the main course  entrees  on their menu.  They're called the  main event .  My wife and I hemmed and hawed for a while over them before settling on the mini pork osso buco for her and the crispy roasted duck for me.  This was a main event as worthy as Randy  Macho Man  Savage versus Ricky  The Dragon  Steamboat.  Both came with sauteed veggies and an interesting take on sweet potatoes that kind of tasted like turkey stuffing.  I wondered if I was still in Vegas after my first delicious bite of the potatoes but then saw the gas station.    The osso buco was tender and full of flavor.  They were cooked with thyme, red wine and plum chipotle and were excellent.   I almost never eat bird skin but the crispness of the duck coupled with the flavor of Maine blueberries and pomegranate juice left me no choice but to devour everything I could until the bones were dry.    We even had room for dessert and a third martini.  The apple strudel was surprisingly light and flaky opposed to most I've had.    Catherine and Jose Luis Pawelek are the heart of it all and make Elements as local as local can be.  Catherine is a terrific hostess and makes everyone feel at home while Jose is the master in the kitchen.

Everything was prepared perfectly, but the short ribs & polenta were absolutely spectacular!  The polenta was a bite of rich and creamy bliss.  The tomato sauce from the albondigas was bursting with flavor, so we decided to hang on to the dish for dipping our bread.    They offer 400+ different martinis to choose from.  I don't like sweet martinis, so I tried the  Hot N Dirty  (Absolut Peppar, dry vermouth, olive juice) and the  Spicy Almond  (Absolut Peppar,Frangelico,dry vermouth,& an almond stuffed olive), which were both delish.  Next time I plan to try  Deb's Blood, Sweat, & Tears , which is Absolut Peppar, Tomato Juice, Olive stuffed with horseradish, & a pickled green bean.  The stuffed olives are my fav; I could make a meal of those!  They also keep a file at the bar for everything that you order in case you forget.

It is located in a strip mall, and doesn't look like much from the exterior facade, but as soon as you open the front door you are greeted with nothing but class!  The services was phenomenal, the chef's wife (and owners I assume) walked the floor of the restaurant the entire time offering explanations of all of the dishes. Her passion for food was intoxicating, or may that was the martini menu that listed over 100 hand shaken specialty martinis. I tried a Blueberry Cheesecake Martini. It was dessert in a glass- creamy and delish, finished at the bottom with actually graham cracker crumbs and blueberries. Amazing.  We tried almost all of the tapas. It was so refreshing to find a tapas bar that has broken out of the Firefly mold. Everything was delicious.   We were going to forgo dessert, but we were surprised to find out the the chef's wife is also the pastry chef, and uses 1/2 to 3/4 less added sugar in her desserts that the main stream average. At the top of the list we found the cheesecake. The flavor changes everyday- and today's featured flavor was Chocolate Peanut Butter.  Creamy and light, this cheesecake was to die for. It was very lightly flavored with an all natural peanut butter, and then drizzled with a chocolate sauce. Served along side was some additional peanut butter (for all of us PB lovers)!

Off the bat I got a bad taste in my mouth cause the waitress refused to give me any sort of list on the 500 mimosa flavors they offer.  I started with a strawberry mimosa and ordered the breakfast burrito. Both were just ok. The burrito was very bland and had no cheese (which it's supposed to come with) and the mimosa had very little strawberry flavor.  After we all ate we focused on drinking and ordered a round of pineapple upside down mimosas...25 minutes later we got them. They were good, but not worth the wait. The next round was supposed to be blackberry, but never came. In fact my husband went to the bar and saw our tray of mimosas just sitting there. About 10 minutes later we got them and they were terrible. They tasted like cough syrup.  Next round I decided to go up to the bar myself and order directly from who I'm assuming was the owner (she was wearing regular clothes whereas everyone else was wearing a uniform). She stood there another 5 minutes drying off glasses so I asked if she was working on my order since the last one took 25 minutes. She said yes and about 10 minutes later they started making them. (This round was cranberry mimosas and were also not that great).  After the last round they ran out of champagne. What?! If you are not prepared to serve bottomless mimosas then don't offer them.

We were always so skeptical because of the area. There are a few really great  hidden  eateries in LV, but most of them we've heard by word of mouth. Last night, we decided to give Elements its FIRST chance.... Upon entering, we were greeted by almost everyone in the restaurant. The restaurant is amazingly decorated inside. There were a few people eating at the bar and a few in the dining room, and it was just perfect. The lights were dim and the ambiance was just right for our date night out! We immediately sat down and were served this amazing baked French bread and Kalamata bread (that our waiter informed us that was baked  in house  by the chef himself). It was served with a side of butter and house made chutney (that was out of this world!) Are you hungry yet???!?!? We spoke with our knowledgeable waiter (Peter) for quite some time about the menu and how it changes frequently. He suggested the proscuitto wrapped jumbo shrimp and the bruschetta which were both amazing! The only disappointment: There's never enough! :) We each ordered a drink off their extensive Martini menu, which boasts over 300 custom martinis. Yes, 300, and they are all alphabetized and described to suit YOUR needs. After another round of bread, we were still chatting it up with our waiter when Catherine, the owner came over to introduce herself and talk about the menu. She informed us of some of the specials for the night and told us that her husband, Luis, is the only solo cook in the restaurant. He's Argentinian, and very passionate about food, which we were starting to understand.. We both ordered the house salad with home-made gorganzola cheese dressing. As our main course, my husband ordered the Sea Bass, and I ordered the special Veal Scaloppine. First, the presentation of these meals were amazing! They were plated so beautifully! It was a pleasant surprise to have something this amazing NOT on the strip and without the chaos! Both were served with an amazing mashed potato (which changes frequently) and vegetables that were prepared divinely. They both came with reduction sauces that beautifully complemented each dish. I'm not a big fish eater, but the Sea Bass was encrusted with black peppercorns and just melted in your mouth. Almost by the end of our main course, the dining room was empty and basically the restaurant had closed. They close at 9:30, but continued to treat us like family all the way through dessert. By this time, we had met the head chef, and owner, Luis, who had personally come out to introduce himself. This allowed us to gush over his meals, which I think he enjoyed ;). Last course, dessert! A specialty by Catherine! She hand makes ALL of the desserts herself-in the restaurant. That's right... Everything is made in HOUSE. We tried the butterscotch bread pudding which was completely amazing! It was warm, gooey and like a slice of heaven! It was beautifully prepared and a complete pleasure to eat! Catherine had also brought out a sample of her truffles and a piece of cheesecake to go for breakfast! After dessert, Luis and Catherine sat at the bar and chatted with us for a little while, when we again, expressed how wonderful our experience was. It has definitely become a place we will go to more often and bring along friends and family! Just another reason WHY you should NEVER judge a book by it's cover!

I had an early show on the Strip, so we went a 4 PM when they satarted dinner service.  I had made a reservation using their website and our table with menus was waiting when we arrived.  Our server was Mimi and she soon brought us iced teas as we studied the menu.  Bread service came quickly and there were three choices.  I did have to ask for butter.  I ordered Jakarta chicken for myself and my wife ordered the vegetable pasta. We started with a bowl of tomato basil soup that was very tasty.  The tomato was very rich and had a flavor that was unlike most tomato soups.  I would go back for some more soup.  Our main courses were quite nice.  They looked like small servings but that was deceiving.  The plates were quite large and somewhat deep so there appeared to be less food than there really was.  My Jakarta chicken was excellent.  Chicken with seasonal vegetables in a Thai peanut sauce with a nice tangy spiciness.  Perfect!  My wife enjoyed her vegetable pasta.  Mushrooms and yellow and green sautéed squash in a sun dried tomato-white wine sauce.  She didn't finish all her pasta so there was room for dessert.  The options for dessert were limited.  I opted for the carrot cake and my wife got the chocolate brownie cheesecake.  Standard desserts but very good and a nice way to end the meal.

The menu is much different from years ago and even from earlier this year, paid tribute by new ownership. I remember it being a funky french-Caribbean fusion at one time. Now the menu has a definite Italian leaning, so that was a surprise we were excited to explore. We kicked off with the baked Mac N Cheese and Meatballs on their small plates menu. They were still in happy hour, score!, so we tried their Ruby Red martini. The martini was good and strong. The Mac n Cheese was delish, meatballs were good, just a tad dense, but the marinara on the side was especially good. My favorite thing on that small plate was surprisingly- the garlic bread!  So good, in fact, that we ordered a side of just the garlic bread, later. Yum!! There's the slightest hint of rosemary that made it stand out from other garlic breads. They also bring a selection of breads to the table at the start of the meal. Try the flat bread crisp. It's like crispy baked cheese, topped with Parmesan and all kinds of good stuff! Loved that.  For entree, we ordered the salmon medium rare, and it came just perfectly cooked over a bed of leeks. Very good entree; my favorite things about the dish was how perfectly the salmon was cooked, the little bits of kale mixed in the leeks (wanted more!!!) and the shoestring potatoes (wanted more!!). I would order those if offered as side items. The fella tried the filet, which also came perfectly medium rare with large tasty asparagus (and you may sub out other veggies if asparagus aren't your thing.) I hear they make a mean Caesar salad, too, but will have to try that next time. Service was good, if not a little flat, so a little cheer would have put it over the top! I also felt that their menu could use a bit more variety. A smile and variety would have bumped it up to a 5 star for me, but I understand and appreciate their small local vibe and the menu restrictions that come with that. They are doing a good job here, and I think the new ownership has brought a lighter atmosphere overall. I definitely recommend checking it out!", "Date": "2015-12-08", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jayme", "ReviewID": "TNJbxE2JqjJhfdtfO8mfpA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Finally came here after almost a year of saying  Oooh, that place looks good. We should try them.  with a groupon last week.   Do you like Pokemon and Alcohol? I do. And that's why I like Elements. Their super extensive drink menu is sort of a mini-game of exploration. You'll find something you like, just by dint of the sheer variety, and they're willing to experiment for you, if you're willing to risk it. (I asked what drink used the bottle of Absolut Cilantro behind the bar, and they confessed they hadn't found one for it yet, but were open to suggestions). The staff didn't just leave me with the small tome, either; even the new guy was happy to talk drinks. Heck yes, thought I, this will be fun. It was.  We weren't super hungry sat at the bar, and got 2 appetizers and a martini a-piece. The restaurant is small and intimate, and though they have a patio, it was the sort of Vegas windy that could toss a Prius, so we opted for inside, and shimmied up to the bar for a snack.   We were greeted right away by who I believe was the owner, and the bartender, and given the option to order up, or take our time; they are aware how huge their drink menu is. Our bartender was really nervous, because it was his first day. So we reassured him that we, too, like normal humans, have had first days, and he and the owner offered to help us pick a drink or come back in a few.  We opted to just try something, and set to arguing over apps. We are not Sweet Cocktail people, and one of the reasons we've never pulled the trigger on Elements was a fear of the 6 oz Chocolate GirlyTini syndrome. But Elements had something for us. I had something called a Glacial Ice, and my husband had a Beanie Baby. Both were herbal and cold and really well made. We enjoyed them immensely. Great job, First Day Bartender!  They were out of the first appetizer we ordered, but the  runner up  was probably better anyway, and we had the Fire and Ice shrimp and scallops, and the Beef Tartare. I wanted to eat all the tartare by myself but I didn't because I am a good and loving wife. The shrimp and scallops...I thought was pretty decent, with the disclaimer that in general I do not like shrimp or scallops or any member of the  boingy  seafood family. My husband does; this was our compromise app. The spice was really nice; hot but flavorful, and the shrimp was actually pretty damn good for someone who doesn't usually like shrimp. I didn't like it as well as the tartare, but that was pretty much a given. My husband, who grew up in Daytona and has Strong Opinions About Seafood declared the shrimp excellent, the scallops  not bad , the sauce, gone. I saw another person had ordered the beef shortrib and really want to try that next time I'm back, which I definitely will be. This seems like the perfect place to take a group of hard-to please friends, especially girls.  I am not very good at being a girl; I tend to prefer sidecars and whiskey and scotch to Flirtinis or Slushie Mangoritas. But I have lots of friends who love these things, which creates a problem when we want to get our mellow drink on; Either I'm miserable or they are. Now I can take them to Elements! They can have their chocolate Tia Maria Almond cocoa...whatever, and be overjoyed at it having found it, and I'm ordering the Green Fairy, or the Quattro-Tini, or the Roadrunner...next time I go.  Can't wait to head back.   Pros: - Alcoholic Pokemon - Good food, and folk and atmosphere.  - Easy parking - Normal Human drink sizes. None of this Fishbowl BS.  Cons: - Little bit on the pricy side for some items for a neighborhood joint; I'm not sure I could afford drinks AND dinner. Just dinner'd be a moderate price point, or just drinks and apps as we did would also be moderate. But I doubt I'll be trying dinner here unless someone else is buying, just because I'm coming here for drinks.", "Date": "2014-06-30", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Alia", "ReviewID": "xVGNDKGKPBP70wwJp7KEDw", "Overall": "4", "Content": "I apologize in advance for the long-winded review. But this place was Great.   Had a lovely meal where we met the chef/owner and his wife (Katherine) who is the pastry chef. Katherine is a delight. She spent a bit of time speaking with us about her desserts and her philosophy on utilizing different types of sugar and sweetening agents. She prefers to use natural sweeteners found in fruits which is fantastic!   The bread (baked fresh ever day) was a caramelized onion today.... The bread changes daily based on how the chef feels that day... and I'm ready to go back tomorrow based on his bread alone just to see what tomorrow's flavor is.   Katherine likes to mix up the dessert menu as well and offers different items daily. And as a parting gift to end our meal, she brought out homemade biscotti cookies. Yum!   So... the food.... aside from the bread which I was totally loving... we started with the Italian white bean soup which was fresh and wholesome and light.   Then we had the short rib w/ polenta, mushrooms and veggie samosas. Mind you... all of these items except for the soup was on their appetizer menu. So, we shared appetizers and were FULL.   Short ribs were melt in your mouth d-lish, mushrooms were sauteed and like the short rib... melt in your mouth fantastic and the veggie samosas were just like everything else... great.... light and not greasy. These were baked not fried.   Now.. let me get back to the Mushrooms.... I try mushrooms at every  nice  restaurant we go to .... which is to say.... we try mushrooms at a different spot at least 12 times a year because we like eating out a lot and usually go to steak type places. These were the best darn sauteed Mushrooms ever! Now they could have come out a little hotter (temperature wise), but the flavor was Amazing and they were juicy, savory and meaty. I like meaty mushrooms not mushy and these were definitely not mushy. And there was enough mushrooms on the plate to feed 4 people... mom and I devoured them.   Did I mention the Martinis? There's a list of over 300. Holy Martinis, Batman! Most of them looked to be on the sweet side and very dessert-like. I had the Pink Flamingo which was made with a pink grapefruit vodka and some other stuff... it tasted just like pink grapefruit juice, you couldn't taste the alcohol... very dangerous stuff. And it hit the spot to my otherwise very trying work-week.   Oh Yea... and the Kicker... everything except for the soup was on the Happy Hour menu... so our bill was $42. You may think this is a little steep... and it probably is.... but this was not your typical Happy Hour Appetizer menu.   Happy Hour runs Mon-Sat from 5-6:30pm where all drinks and appetizers are $2 off.

I am ashamed to say that if not for a foodie group of friends I would never have tried Elements because it is not on my side of town and nothing about it would have necessarily stood out to me...MY LOSS!!  So, last night was my first time at Elements. It is sort of small, but I literally loved everything.  First, The food was amazing. It was all made to order, very fresh, a souped up version of classics. We had bruchetta for an appetizer (on homemade bread) and I had steak with veggies and mashes potatoes. I had a hard time choosing between the steak and the halibut, but the steak won. Every single thing on my plate was cooked perfectly, which surprised me because I was with a large group. My friend had the duck with a blueberry topping that looked delicious, and even though I am not typically a duck fan I was a little jealous because it looked so beautiful!! Oh, and vanilla bean panacotta with raspberry sorbet was pretty amazing too.  Secondly, they have a list of martinis that stretches from Las Vegas to the Sun and back 57 times. If there is a flavor you like you can randomly shout it out and your server will have 12 or so recommendations right off the top of his head (I was impressed). I tried the Pussycat Doll martini which was a lime, peach, and pineapple concoction. A+. Then I tried the S'mores martini which I didn't care for and only gave that a D. I was upset I didn't try the Pineapple Upside Down Martini or the Key Lime Pie Martini or the Blueberry Cheesecake Martini...let's just say I have a new bucket list goal of trying them all.  They, also, have a Martini Club that is free to join (you fill out a card and they keep it behind the bar so you will never have to worry about forgetting it). And, for every 12 you try, the 13th one is free!! I highly recommend checking out the martini menu before you go so you have an idea of what you want to try because they have OVER 450 to choose from.  And, saving the best for last...the service was out of this world!! The server was patient with our large group. He knew the menu inside out (including all 450+ martinis), no one was left waiting for anything including drink refills, and yet he wasn't all over us either. PERFECT. Also, the owner works the room, giving personal attention to each table...not because there is a problem, but just because, and that attention to detail is impressive and really goes a long way!!  It was, also, recommended to me by a fellow patron that I follow on Twitter or FB because they often plan the menu the day of based on chef whims.

We started off with the calamari, tasted just like your typical restaurant calamari. Nothing to write home about. We also received bread as an appetizer, but tasted rather stale and was served cold. The owner was telling us her husband baked it fresh every morning which might have been the reason since it's from the morning. The steak I ordered on the other hand was amazing. Cooked perfectly medium rare packed full of flavor. The dessert menu is very unique too. Lots of stuff you won't find anywhere else like dessert coffees and martinis. My girlfriend and I got the two creme brulees and was very good.   On a separate note, I noticed they place butcher paper over the table clothes. I know this is to prevent stains on cloths to save money from buying new ones, but it comes off cheap to me and takes away from the otherwise chic theme.

The atmosphere was pretty cool. There were about six people that seemed to be having a good time, which made me enjoy this place a bit more. I could see a gentlemen buss tables and help Karla out. I later found out his name Kevin, and he's actually the manager. It was very pleasing to see that they had a good chemistry. As far as food goes, I ordered the braised short rib and the fire and ice. The short rib was a lot better than I assumed it would be. It was so tender. By far as good as it can get. I then tried the shrimp and scallops, both of which were cooked to perfection. The spicy chipotle sauce was incredible. I'm glad I stopped at this place. I had a great time. Food was great, drinks were good and service was phenomenal! Overall a great experience.

Totally unacceptable.  The food itself was good.  It's clear the chef knows what they're doing, however with all of their entrees being 19 dollars and up, I would say it's overpriced for what you get.

At one time a popular hangout for the upper-middle class living near the junction of Tropicana and South Rainbow, the wordy-titled restaurant having undoubtedly gone through its fair share of mundane menus and troubles since the heights of its success, new ownership smartly decided to reach out for assistance in the early part of 2016, and led to VanHusen through Chef Johnny Church the hirsuit youngster undoubtedly comes highly touted by several local kitchen vets of whom he speaks fondly, his presence at local Farmer's Markets also showing the sort of appreciation common amongst his peers for premium ingredients sourced by local purveyors and Intuitive Forager Kerry Clasby.  Not yet given the chance to fully reinvent the menu, several Italian standards still predominating alongside soups, salads, burgers and daily specials, it was actually Chef Jon's volunteering to show the Los Angeles Kings season finale that lured me into Elements and although the interior is in dire need of some upgrades, as is the music, the vibe wass nonetheless calm and pleasant while service proved surprisingly competent despite a young lady only on her second day in.  Unenthusiastic about the main room's options, though a few bar-bites and snacks proved quite delicious with Coconut Shrimp bathed in sweet Mayo not decidedly different from Asian Walnut Prawns while the Meatballs and Marinara are a veritable steal for just four bucks, it was with deference to VanHusen that the rest of the meal was served carte-blanche and starting things off with a bit of gametime popcorn it was not long before I was smiling despite my team's consistent failings, the simple Nicoise Salad not looking to reinvent the wheel but at the same time performing better than most as ruby-red cubes of seared Tuna melted on the tongue next to a hardboiled egg, tender potatoes, olive tapenade, snappy vegetables and cornichons.  From here on offering only one item from the current menu, a row of Cannolis next to Brûléed bananas that compete with Chris Palmeri's for best in town, tuna was followed by thinly sliced Lamb Carpaccio whose intrinsic grassiness was allowed to shine beneath citrus yogurt, fresh garlic and pita crumbs, the Mediterranean flavors leaping off the plate as if to give notice that Spring has finally come.  With rain again falling outdoors, the crowd small and full of regulars including the owner who sat near the kitchen at the bar, savories concluded with VanHusen's nightly special of New York Strip grilled just shy of medium alongside a duo of side dishes, the spring pea risotto toothsome yet smooth with bright vegetal notes and an air of mint while the skillet cornbread was really quite spectacular as the base ate like a fallen soufflé beneath a caramelized top of molten butter and brown sugar.  Stating that a portion of the new menu would be served  family style,  desserts particularly prone to such service as many only seem to want a few bites of something sweet to end the night, VanHusen's first dessert was an updated look at his well-regarded cannolis, and although perhaps not as texturally compelling as the cylindrical version served in comparison the flavor was virtually spot-on as smooth mascarpone was enlivened by orange zest and mint plus shaved dark chocolate alongside seasonal berries.  Most assuredly not the sort of person to skimp on desserts, the grand finale often at least as relevant as the savories served before, it was with good fortune that a request to see more was a challenge Chef Jon was ready to accept, for as good as the rest had been nothing could have prepared me for the plate of Praline Brownies that may just be the city's best new dessert offering, each fudgy wedge topped in caramelized banana peanut butter and a ball of malted ice cream with crunchy almond rocca adding texture as a perfume of cinnamon helps to lighten the heft.  Taking it upon himself to adlib one last plate, grilled Angel-food cake served next to dollops of smooth espuma and kumquats a lighter, more elegant dish better suited for one, it was after a long conversation about his history and the local dining scene that the Chef returned to the kitchen to scrub down and retire for the evening, perhaps to even catch a few Zzzs before returning the next day for Sunday brunch.", "Date": "2016-04-11", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Trina", "ReviewID": "8GxeCaVQHhJDdIJXQmuE2w", "Overall": "3", "Content": "I like a place where you can sit and eat at the bar, chat up the bartenders, and have a great dinner.

The food is presented beautifully, all very tasty, and the drinks are no exception.    Everything is made in-house, from dessert to drinks.

We walked in and it was pretty empty, which for some reason always makes me nervous, because shouldn't a good place be packed and have a huge wait.  Well, I learned my lesson... I definitely should not be judging this book by its cover.    We started our meal with mimosas.  The best way to start the day in my opinion.  The menu is small, which is exactly what I need since places with pages and pages of menu can be overwhelming and take forever to sift through to figure out what you want.  The short menu helped me get straight to what I wanted.  We decided to split the beef sliders and I got the breakfast burrito.  The sliders were awesome and their fries were AMAZING.  I can truly appreciate some good french fries, and these were worth it!  My breakfast burrito was also on point.  I do wish the chorizo had more of a kick to it, but just a minor detail compared to the meal as a whole.  I LOVED the live music!! There were just two guys playing piano and saxophone and singing in the corner and it was definitely a great addition to the vibes the places was letting out!   Another small hiccup in our visit was that we got coffee and it took a lengthy time to finally get to our table.  For how slow they were when we first entered, I was surprised by how long it took for our food to come out and our mimosas to be refilled.  But, for the prices, I honestly don't deserve to complain.  Another great thing about this place is that you can switch from mimosas to blood mary's and vice versa if you choose.

Once inside you see the bar/lounge. It's comfy to kinda tight spaced. Immediately to the left the dining area appears like a fine dining restaurant. White tablecloths, wine glasses on the tables. But on the tabletops are brown wrapping paper. If you don't have a budget to change and clean white table clothes either top them with glass or better yet just get rid of them. Also devoid of any condiments like salt and pepper. Just an unlit candle holder.   Only 2 tables served during my visit but it's a holiday and I like less distractions... the design of the place makes any bar talk audible throughout the place; also sounds from the kitchen. The server was a one woman show and very good at menu description, attentiveness and personality. The menu has some nice appetizers on it including scallops and calamari but i try to keep to a budget of $25 for 1 person. I ordered the day's soup which was Cream of Broccoli Asparagus. The server warned me it didn't have chunks as she liked it and she was right; it was a puree, sadly. Good taste and consistency but deserved more. For an entree I chose the Elements Jambalaya dish. It was good but at $19 it should stand out. The portion was fine, there were enough shrimp but they are med. sized; They should use fewer but jumbo sized to make it look impressive. It has grilled chicken and that was great... but it also said to have sausage and I found none in the dish. The rice and sauce mixture seemed sort of off. something about the rice. I like long grain and some wild rice mixed in but this was closer to a risotto. Not the  dirty rice  on the menu. At $12 more this dish should not lose out to a Popeye's.   It was only one visit, I'll give it another try before I form a solid opinion but I'd make some changes to the place.  1. Ditch the table clothes and wine glasses on tables. Go with nice placemats on wood, maybe with pictures of the feature dishes to build expectations.  2. Get rid of that dividing half wall between  the dining and bar.

I'd like to start mine by stating a few things people should take into consideration when they decide to give someone their hard earned money.  This is a small business. Family owned and may as well be considered family staffed. You feel this when you are there as the entire staff takes great pride in what they do. They will do anything you ask that can be physically done in their kitchen (ever gone somewhere and make a simple request and they looked at you like you asked them to move mountains?)  Also, this place is not on the Strip. Which for me increases its value. I don't understand why paying for quality food, drinks and service seems so odd when people are stating they would be willing to pay for less if it was on the Strip. There are plenty of places on the Strip that charge as much or more for less if that's your aim pick one.  If you're looking for great food, great people, a memorable experience, amazing drinks and aren't pretentious enough to care its snuggled between a gas station and an apartment complex then I urge you to try this local treasure.  PS: Catherine would be the guilty one if she didn't come out after dinner and encourage people to try what is one of the best things about Elements.

First impression: we were seated at a table right in front of a door that wait staff were going in and out of (to the outdoor patio). To top it off, the table was REALLY wobbly.  Second impression: ordered the bruschetta to start...mediocre. Bread was not toasted enough thus it was soggy. Tomatoes not very flavorful.  Third impression: ordered the grilled vegetable pasta. For $18, I could have made this at home for about $5. Menu said it had mushrooms...no mushrooms. Not very flavorful, even a hint of olive oil or garlic would have helped.

The dining room is small and there is also a small patio outside.   SCALLOPS?!! Yes please!!! It's dinner time baby! At first glance at the menu, I'm thinkin Calamari... THEN I saw the Wood grilled fire & ice scallops and shrimp! Game on!! Obvi I ordered this aaaand it was perfectly cooked! The scallops were so tender and DELICIOUS and the sauce that accompanied it was freakin' tasty as well!! Friend also ordered bruschetta, a half and half plate of Chicken Pesto bruschetta and Tomato Basil bruschetta. Both were nommy as well!  Friend ordered the steak and although he likes his steak medium-well, I tried a bite and it was GOOD! It was crispy on the outside and it was juicy on the inside! I opted for the special of the evening which was a kind of shrimp fettuccine with a mildy spicy creamy red sauce. It wasn't bad at all - but I was pretty stuffed from the apps.  For dessert I grabbed the last piece of triamsu and friend got the house made brownies. OH. MY. GOD. Brownies were SOOOOOOOOO good!! The brownies came out warm and ooey gooey on the inside and they was SOOOOOOOO damn delicious! HOLY COW!! My triamsu wasn't bad either, I really liked the little cookie thing it came with and the triamsu itself was nice and moist but the brownie really was THE best. Definitely try this!! ! This is a martini bar and they have a menu FULL of martini's, like A LOT!!! I decided I would try one, so I opted for the Brazilian Blue - I believe it has Stoli Blueberry, Blue Curacao, Pineapple and Pomegranate juice in it. It was OK... First I kind of thought it tasted like grape kool-aid. Friend said it tasted like medicine... I only drank about half and switched to the Red Sangria. This was OK too..

The martini list is about 8 pages long and the girls and I had a great time reading through all the descriptions and deciding which ones to order. I don't remember the names now but all of our Martinis were strong and delicious.   For the food, we stuck to the appetizers:   Soup - Both the girls got the soup of the day which was a pasta fagioli and raved about it. It smelled delicious but I didn't actually try it.  Bruschetta - apparently the topping changes daily - our visit included venison sausage and caramelized onions - This was really delicious but I enjoy a topping that softens the baguette a little bit so a drizzle of olive oil or something would have made this just a tad better for me.   Vermont Goat Cheese Salad - I really enjoyed this refreshing salad with flavors that blended very well together. The marinated bell peppers and mandarin oranges were perfectly matched with the creamy goat cheese.   Kona Beef Short Rib over Gorgonzola Polenta - This was FANTASTIC! I want to go back and get it again ASAP.  For dessert we had a pair of mini creme brulees - one with fresh kiwi on the bottom and the other with a cinnamon apple mixture on the bottom.  We also shared two 250ml bottles of a Strawberry Champagne that was highly recommended to us by the servers. The champagne was a refreshing treat for the end of our meal and had pureed strawberries in it that tasted wonderfully fresh and not too sweet.   This service at this restaurant was simply wonderful - both the Owners made many visits to our table to make sure they could answer any questions about the menu, make suggestions for us, or just ensure we were enjoying ourselves and the food.

A prix fixe menu was available as was their regular menu -- changed and pared down greatly from the previous regime according to others who've dined here before.  The calimari was undercooked with the breading limp and chewy. The short rib wasn't bad -- easily the highlight of the meal -- but the reduction had a slightly sweet taste that muddled what would have been a solid savory profile. The penne a la vodka was incredibly bland with very little chicken, no basil, and a sauce no better than that from a can. It was so bad that my wife took one or two bites and pushed it away. We told our server how bad it was and he was gracious enough to take it off our bill.

The appeal for me initially was the $10 bottomless mimosa and Bloody Mary option, with the purchase of an entree.  This sounded to me like something a lot of my friends would enjoy, and I thought it would be a nice way to start my birthday.  We arrived a few minutes before they opened, with a party of 10, and silly me had actually forgotten to make the reservation, but they were very accommodating, putting two tables together for us right away.    Our server, Rigo, was very polite and attentive, taking good care of us, in addition to the other tables that arrived while we were there.  He never let our Bloody Mary glasses stay empty for more than a minute or two.    I unfortunately didn't catch the bartender's name, but she was great too.  She makes a mean Bloody Mary!  They were really good.  The food was good as well. They have a super limited menu for brunch, made a bit more limited by having a broken waffle iron.  The prices were for me, honestly, a little high, but the quality of the food was good for the cost.  I ordered the Bennie with the filet and potatoes.  It was very filling, and delicious.  The steak was seasoned well, and cooked just a hare over the mid-rare I asked for, but only on the second bennie.  The first one was mid-rare with a perfectly poached egg.  The second bennie was a bit more medium to well, and the egg was slightly over cooked, but it was still full of flavor.    The rest of the party seemed to enjoy their food as well.  The breakfast burritos were huge, and we ended up taking half home.

Fail.  The location at the end of a strip mall, right next to a gas station, with neon  Open  and  Blue Moon  signs in the window did nothing for me. Actually, they frightened me.   But walking in, I loved the feel, immediately, of the little place. Large bar on the right with more than enough room to eat at, a supreme liquor and wine selection visible, a little room divider that divided the bar from the dining area, while leaving the place open and airy, and a quaint, intimate little eating area. We loved the warm and eclectic decor of the place. It sort of reminded us of gems you find in old historical buildings in downtown areas like Aspen, Park City, etc.   Our server was very pleasant and very knowledgable about the martini menu, the daily specials, the entire menu, etc. She gave enough information and answered our few questions so we felt comfortable ordering.  I had the Eiffel Tower Martini, Boyfriend had the CEO. ($9 each) Both were great. Out came the complimentary bread with their homemade chutney and butter. I'm not much of a bread eater - but both were fresh and tasty. We shared an appetizer - the bruschetta ($8) with the daily toppings. Ours were spicy andouille sausage with mushrooms and onions. Incredibly savory with a little kick, and the portion size was double what we were expecting.  We both had the house salad ($5), him with the homemade balsamic vinagrette and me with the homemade gorgonzola dressing. The ingredients, though simple, were fresh and ripe and the dressing, for both of us, was amazing.   Choosing our  Main Event' was a little challenging. There were so many things that sounded so good. However, two of the dishes contained curry - something I despise, and as there were maybe 15 main events - that seemed like 1 too many to me.  Boyfriend went with the mini pork osso bucco ($23), and I chose the peppercorn filet ($29).   The presentation was beautiful. We both had a mix of whipped regular and sweet potato that was fantasic, and a really good veggie side that included many fresh vegetables (squash, zucchini, red peppers, green beans) and was spiced up with what tasted like some creole seasoning. They were delicious. The osso buco was fall off the bone tender, in an absolutely amazing blackberry sauce. One bite of his, and I was afraid I ordered wrong. But, my filet was cooked perfectly, fork tender, and the peppercorns and sauce were absolutely to die for. My only  complaint  was I wish there had been a petit filet offered, as I took half of my filet home. I can't decide whose dinner I loved more, they were both delicious and perfectly prepared.  Our server was present the perfect amount. We never felt like she was hovering or driving us crazy, and whenever we seemed to want something (more water, another martini) she seemed to intuitly know and be right there.   As we were finishing our meal, the owner came out and introduced herself to us (but alas, I forgot her name) and we chatted about the menu, their use of fresh ingredients, etc., quite a bit. She went over the dessert menu with us, which was great for me as it was my birthday. I was definitely ordering dessert. The only problem? Which one? We chose the chef's selection ($10) and left it in the chef's hands.  Out came our plate with enough dessert for 4 people. We had the apple peach streudel with cinnamon (our top favorite, it was absolutely amazing), thhe white chocolate raspberry bread pudding, which was simply divine, the hybiscus creme brulee, which competed with the streudel for favorite, it was the best creme brulee we have ever had, and we not only order it quite a bit, we cook it often ourselves. While still being thick and creamy - it was lighter than most, and the hibiscus added the nicest, cleanest flavor. Divine. There was also creme de menthe bread pudding. It tasted really good, and the bread pudding consistency was perfect, but it was a little too rich for both of us. And last, but certainly not least, there was what I am pretty confident was homemade vanilla ice cream. It complimented the streudel very nicely. There were also pretty little sugar and chocolate designs standing up in the desserts. Very chic and gourmet.   Since the closing down of Bleu Gourmet and then Rosemary's, - we were both so excited to find this little gem. I love amazing food, and as a Vegas native, I love going to restaraunts that are locally owned and operated.   The location won't stop me - it's easy to get to. They do need to work on their music selection. It was kind of weird to be in a quaint, gourmet little room and hear Brittney Spears  Hit Me Baby One More Time  and that  Call Me Maybe  song.

We made reservations and they were not busy, but that they only staffed one server for Sunday brunch. Rigo was managing four tables in addition to our 10-person party!   Menu for brunch is limited, and made more limited by their waffle maker being broken. Many at the table opted for the breakfast burrito or the benedict (available with filet, crab, or salmon), but I chose the BRIE GRILLED CHEESE & TOMATO SOUP. Menu description states the sandwich includes tomato, but I received only a generous amount of cheese resulting in a basic and one-note sandwich of just cheese and bread. The tomato soup was sweet, oily, and rich, did not necessarily pair well with the sandwich. Highly suggest adding a side salad (a Caesar is $7 and huge) to cut the richness.   Of the three people who opted for the breakfast burrito, only one ate more than half, which I found noteworthy.  The main appeal for brunch is their $10 bottomless Mimosa or Bloody Mary deal, with mandatory entrée purchase. They have a full bar and patio seating.

I purchased a Groupon for this restaurant and made a reservation for last Sat night.  We entered the tiny restaurant in which the bar takes up most of it, which is an initial turn off for someone who doesn't drink or like a loud bar atmosphere. We were seated in a tiny table for two next to a large group.  I ordered Liz's Penne Ala Vodka and my husband ordered the flank steak with Chimichurri Sauce.  Our food arrived and I took one bite of mine and sent it back immediately.  I could easily see that the chicken was BURNED in it and the dish tasted as though someone had thrown a lit cigarette into it, YUCK!  The manager came over with a menu and apologized but told me that they use smoked chicken in the dish....I asked if they always BURN smoked chicken as well then?  My husband took a bite of his dish and sent it back.  It was entirely a salt feast and there is NO WAY that was Chimichurri Sauce!  (I am from FL where we have good Chim Sauce, this stuff was SOY based!!!!) We both reviewed the menu to try to select other options when the  DJ  a young girl, starts playing VERY loud rap music. No offsense about rap music, I enjoy all types of music, but did I mention this place is TINY and she is BLASTING it right next to us??  We finally flagged the manager over and asked if we may just cancel our dinner as we prefer to go elsewhere as this was not working for us.  He handled it very well so I give kudos for that and left.....went to Gordon Biersch and had a great dinner!  Sorry, I see a lot of people like this place, I just don't understand WHY!

I have driven past Elements plenty of time but thought nothing of it. April F. invited me out for dinner and we met up with some friends. She made a reservation but on this Wednesday night there were plenty of tables.   I was pleasantly surprised at the creativity of the menu. Just reading through I could pick out at least 5 appetizers I wanted and 5 entrees. We decided on the braised short ribs on polenta and Pear/Gorgonzola salad to start. The short ribs were so tender and delicious!! The salad was pretty darn good. Bread came along side the appetizers which was delicious as well.  It was ladies night on Wednesday night which meant $10 off bottles of wine! Yes! High five!  For the main course, April and I split the Osso Buco (SPECTACULAR) as well as the Mussels in curry cream sauce (DELICIOUS) and the calamari (OOOH SO TENDER).  Catherine, the owner, kept coming by to check on us. Then after dinner she decided to verbally entice us with her descriptions of the desserts. There were too many to choose from so she suggested getting the chef's sampler. $16 for the popular desserts on the menu! GENIUS!!  We had the bread pudding, creme brulee,...I CAN'T Remember the rest due to the wine but all were so good!! I also had an almond joy latte which had almond, coconut and espresso. SO GOOD.

Would never return!  During last night's visit, I understood they are in transition, (and the 400 plus martini selection will eventually be gone), but it took a long time to get a martini sitting at the bar. With an inexperienced new bartender, I asked him to pull my file card which Elements kept on file to track number of martinis ordered. (Like a punch card.) He had no idea what I was talking about. (Apparently, the new owners ditched this.) I told him I wanted a Freddy-O, and 10 minutes later tells me he couldn't find it on the drink menu. (He thought I said Jackie O.) More time waiting. My boyfriend ordered a glass of white wine, and 10 minutes later, was told that they were no longer carrying that bottle, and had to substitute with another one.  After seeing a kitchen crew member talking outside of the kitchen for 20 minutes talking to another employee I knew ordering dinner there would be a big mistake.   Last year, I bought a groupon for Elements and had a fifteen dollar discount. I presented it to the bartender asking if I could use it. He took the voucher from me, questioned the validity of it to another bartender, helped another bar customer,  and never returned to us.

We had about 16 of our friends gather here for drinks and tapas and had a phenomenal time at a very reasonable price.  The owner Catherine and her staff took exremely good care of us, allowing us to mingle on the patio early in the evening and sit down at a large table inside as the evening got cooler.  Initially she thought it would be too cold for us to be outside, but after we convinced her otherwise she had no problem accommodating us, having our appetizers brought outside as well, and drink orders were taken and served on the patio without any hassle.  All of the food that we sampled was absolutely delicious, receiving several rave comments from our friends as well--and I'm pretty sure it wasn't just the alcohol talking.    Some of the more memorable dishes:  1)  Wild mushroom medley:  one of my absolute favorites, and I don't even like mushrooms that much.  My wife chose it for the vegetarian folk, but I'm pretty sure I was responsible for eating most of it.  2)  Kona beef short ribs:  I've always been a fan of coffee-braised short ribs, but these were just so succulent and tender.  I'd go back for these in a heartbeat.  3)  Moroccan lamb sausage:  interesting flavors and textures...definitely not your run-of-the-mill sausage  4)  Fried calamari:  lightly fried and very tender, what more can you ask for?  5)  Also had the jumbo shrimp marnier, samosas with a curry sauce, and spinach and feta  triangles  also served with the curry sauce.  It was all good.   Unfortunately we did not have any of the large plates so I can't comment on them, but given how good the small plates were I don't really think you can go wrong.  Now onto the drinks.  The  martini menu   (most of these wouldn't qualify as martinis, so I use the term loosely)  is extensive, mostly featuring drinks of the sweeter variety.  However, the bartender is perfeclty willing (and capable, I might add) to make drinks to your personal tastes, so you don't have to stick with the straight menu offerings.  Regardless, all of our friends from the casual drinker to the amateur mixologist found something they liked.  And I should add that these drinks can be *stiff*.  After we had moved inside, had another round of drinks, and finished the appetizers, Catherine came by with a special birthday gift of sorts - dessert plates for the table (three total), featuring a sampler of all of their homemade desserts.  Creme brulee, brownies, bread pudding, cheesecake, and a few others I can't quite recall.  And they were all freaking fantastic.  However, I should qualify that I was feeling pretty darn good by this point in the evening, so take it for what it's worth.  Finally, the check.  We were there during happy hour so the reduced prices applied, and one of our guests characterized the total as  crazy, but in the good way.   He also made the most memorable comment that,  looking at the level of drunkenness around the table, there is no way that the bill should be that low.   Granted most of us are from the Bay Area where cocktails can be a bit spendy, but it's nice to not get sticker shock when you look at the drink total for 14 or 15 people.  Anyway, the review is a little on the long side but we had such a great time, the food and drinks were fantastic, and we were taken such good care of that I really want people to go here if they are in Las Vegas and keep these folks in business.  They are a ways off the strip so a cab is recommended if you'll be drinking, but it was definitely worth it..", "Date": "2009-11-30", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Gretchen", "ReviewID": "6CrJ1vckGHyMWah_bRqPvg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "I'll make a long, happy story short.

I've worked in the hospitality industry since I was 15 and that's a big deal to me if I can't get my drink refilled. I didn't take any stars away for that only because I was the designated driver that night and my wife amd our 2 friends (other couple) were drinking martinis and wine and not once did they have to ask for another drink on their own. The server was VERY attentive to the bar drinks so I let the soda issue slide. Food was fantastic and desserts were good as well. We were staying at New York, New York and this place was WAY cheaper tham a strip restaurant of it's caliber.
