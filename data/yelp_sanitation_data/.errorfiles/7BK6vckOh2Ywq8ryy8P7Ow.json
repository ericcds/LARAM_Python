We ordered the Beach burger and Big Kahuna burger. We had an order of regular fries and  Rumbi  fries (which are basically a 50/50 splits of regular and sweet potato). Top it off with two fountain drinks and a brownie. It was a meal of indulgence for fast food.  Food arrived looking fantastic. The Kahuna has a thick slice of fresh pineapple, perfectly caramelized and sweet. There was a thousand island style dip, but I opted for the classic ketchup. The meat was juicy with two nice patties, melting along the cheese and warming the already toasty bun.  I'm not a fan of sweet potato fries but the regular fries were good. Needed a bit more salt, but only because of personal preference.  Overall the food was delicious. I would definitely visit again. The decor was nice, the facility was very clean, and service was fantastic. Best of all, I can finally say that I've had a big Kahuna burger.   Mmm-mmmm. That is a tasty burger.

However the kahuna burger was AWESOME , I recommend this burger because it was juicy, and had the right amount of sweetness. (Due to the pineapple) it's right across the street from unlv and its convenient and cheap! However I don't think the rhumbi fries were worth it. It's a mixture of normal fries and sweet potato fries . I only got about 5 sweet potato fries. For an additional 1.45 I think it was ?

Since it was my friend's first time there, he gave us the run down on their menu. I ordered a half sized rice bowl with luau pork, steak and brown rice and my friend ordered the Oahu fish sandwich special.  You get a number and they bring the food out to your table.  Before our food arrived, they gave us complimentary chips and salsa (their version). The chips were a bit thick and hard but fresh and the salsa was pretty good and mild.    My friend loved her fish sandwich with her mix of regular and sweet potato fries. The fish looked crunchy and the bun was soft. The sweet potato fries were my favorite - they are crinkle cut!    My bowl was abundant with perfectly cooked rice and the highlight was the luau pork, it was divine!   The steak was good but you don't get much of it with the half portion. I loved the veggies - zucchini, carrots and broccoli. I think their rice bowls are much better than Samarai Sam's by far.  SO many choices!!  My only suggestion is for them to not serve so much rice. It's a bit of a waste....I would rather get more veggies. Maybe I will ask next time!  They also gave me two sauces on the side because I couldn't choose between the jerk or the teriyaki. The jerk was a bit salty for my taste but the teriyaki was perfect.  Of course, too much rice and sauce preference is a personal thing ;-)  I am a stickler for iced tea and they had that yummy tropical tea that you usually get at some of the Asian chains.

Panda is closer to my office but I find that their dishes are too sweet even the ones that are supposed to be spicy.  I ordered the combo chicken and steak bowl with spicy sauce and brown rice to go.  One thing that irks me about some restaurants is when there is a tip line on the debit/credit card receipt.  They are basically asking for a tip immediately after you order and haven't really received any type of customer service yet and the dish was over $9.  Anyway, when I returned to my office to try the dish, unfortunately I didn't like it.  The chicken was extremely dry, the steak was chewy and the rice was very dry and hard.  The sauce was o.k.  The steak was so chewy and fatty I almost broke my plastic fork twice trying to cut it.

Today I'm trying the mango salad and shared some Rumbi fries with Jesse N.  He got the Luau burger I think that was what it was called, it was like Kalua Pork sandwich.  Well, I got the salad because I'm saving those calories for dessert.  I got my eyes on the mango cheesecake.    They are located right across UNLV.  Cute spot, reminds me of a haole version of Kuuaina's back home (I don't mean that in a bad way).   Let me start off with Rumbi had served us with great customer service.  They were very attentive and suggested things on the menu since it was our first time.  Mango salad was pretty monstrous,  if your not a fan of blue cheese, you should ask for no cheese (I like blue cheese).  The mango was cut into itty bitty pieces.  They mix the salad dressing into the salad.  I think having the option to pour it on ourselves would be a better suggestion.  Rumbi fries are perfect for those that want to get a mixture of both Sweet potato (crinkled) fries and regular fries.  Which I am one who can't decide between the two.  Its not out of this world, but convenient for an undecided person like me.  Suggestion however, not to add too much salt.  I might ask for the fries without salt next time.    Jesse N.  said the burger was okay, again said it was a bit too salty.  When he got his first one it wasn't that hot so he did return it to have it heated up.  But they were very kind and gave him a new one & made sure that he came back to enjoy another meal.  I didn't try the burger, just the meat from his burger.  Jesse will review it for himself.    Mango Cheesecake was delicious.  A cheesecake with Mango sauce drizzled atop.  Just the right size to share between the 2 of us.  I forgot to mention, their Ice Tea is delicious.  I went back to refill my cup before I left.  I love tea and having a tropical tea flavored one makes it even better.    Am I going to return, sure.

We came around 5:30pm on a Saturday night.  No one was in the restaurant.  There were 2 employees working, one cashier and one  cook .  We ordered a BBQ chicken salad and an orange chicken bowl.  Also, the rumba fries.  I had a groupon so I paid 8.00 for 16.00 worth of food.  I had to pay 3 more dollars.  It took FOREVAH!! for the food to be served to me.  The salad was big, tons of lettuce and not that much chicken.  My spouse was served a teriyaki chicken bowl.  I said   this isn't what I ordered .  The cook said   Yes it is  and  I said   Nope, its not .  Spouse said she would just eat it.  After one bite, she says   taste this chicken .  I tasted it and it didn't taste like chicken, it tasted like pork.  I brought it back and said that I wanted what I originally ordered.    That took another 10-15 min.  By this point, 6 other customers came in the the  cook  was overwhelmed.  Ridiculous.   My spouse got her frozen, reheated chicken nuggets, drizzled with orange sauce and canned mandarin oranges.

The reviews seemed a little bit up and down so I had to check this place out with my own eyes. The verdict? I'll use the overused Yelp term,  pleasantly surprised !  I believe the concept here is Hawaiian/Caribbean fusion. Even though this is the first time I have ever heard of this, it does make a lot of sense to do so because they share a lot of tropical ingredients.  This store is located right across the street from the UNLV. The layout on in the inside is definitely a tropical theme. I was dead set on getting a combo plate and burger, the advertisements all over the place were singing the praises of their pineapple upside down cake. Having not one of these since I was a mere lad, pineapple upside down took the place of the burger. Also got a side of Rumbi fries instead.  Combo plate - decided on getting the 2 meat combo of pork and grilled chicken. The chicken was a little bit dry, but not that much. It had a nice chargrilled taste to it. I like the fact that their Kailua pork had a very subtle sweetness to it, and wasn't salty as f*ck like how a lot of places make it. I ordered brown rice and was glad they didn't use long grain brown rice, which is terrible even if it cooked correctly. They used a short grain one and it was pretty good. The stir fried veggies were good and didn't taste like they used frozen veggies. I liked the sesame oil taste to them. The only thing I didn't like was their teriyaki sauce that was thankfully put into a small container on the side. It might as well could have been maple syrup, it was that sweet.  Rumbi fries - here's a hint, ask them to put their blackened seasoning on them, it's really tasty. The Rumbi fries are a mix of regular shoe string fries, and thick sweet potato fries. Both were crispy, and the creole-like spice seasoned them very well. The dipping sauce tasted like a looser dynamite sauce and complemented the fries well.  Pineapple upside down cake - the last time I've had this was about 20 years ago and I made it from a Betty Crocker mix. Trust me, this was nothing like that. The cake had a complex pound cake like flavor, except being a whole lot lighter. The pineapple was nice but probably canned, and the whole thing wasn't too sweet, so I was pretty surprised.  The food came out fast and was well prepared. Hopefully when school is back in session these guys will start to pick up because I thought the food and service was pretty good here. One thing I didn't like is that they wouldn't let me use the yelp check in with the Groupon, but I guess you can't win them all.

It was kind of a lark, in that we were both very hungry and decided on a whim to come in.  We thought the name and the décor were interesting.  I am not here to beat a dead horse, I just wanted it to be known where we were coming from on this review.  It will be right above my wife's review.  So, after the experience last time, the manager was kind enough to contact us.  He contacted us quickly.  We ended up with a refund and 2 free dinner meals, neither of which we asked for or expected.  He was genuinely concerned and you could tell he cared.  I appreciate that.  Nothing in this review should negate that at all, but I also want to be honest and to give a fair review because as a Manager myself, I find that yelp! and other services like it definitely help you find the kernels of truth that help you improve and invigorate your business, customer service, and your interface with the people who visit your establishment.  So, that all said, here we go with visit 2:  The food was good.  The food was hot.  The young lady that brought it to us was nice and gave us extra napkins without asking.  However, at the register my son asked for his  Beach Burger  to be without tomato and onion. a He repeated it several times.  The burger had tomato and onion on it.  No problem, you can just pull them off and this allowed me to have extra tomato on mine.  Easy to forgive.  At the register, we presented our free meal coupons from the first visit and from the Manager and for some reason, they had to do them separate.  That means we got the same thing basically, but I had to get two swipes of my debit card, 2 receipts, 2 number cards for the table and so on.  It seems very inefficient.  Much like the last time, all the trouble really happens at the register.  We had to repeat our orders several times.  We wanted to make sure and there were still hiccups.  Another thing to consider is sustainability - 2 transactions for a father and son who sit at the same table, come in at the same time and are together seems like a waste - of time, paper, energy and patience.  I think it must have to do with how they input into the register, but I believe business pays a small fee for debit/credit transactions and so they paid it twice.  Still, really?  No big deal, I'm not upset or anything, but with just 2 visits to go on, this seems the sore spot in the operation.  Once you order and get your food, the food is good - heck, great for the price - and many of the staff members are very nice and are trying.  No complaints on this visit there.  To Brett, I believe his name is, who was so nice to us and made us give the place a second chance, I say thank you.  My wife declined the offer due to the rice bowl, but the burgers are good and I understand what restaurant management is like, I have done it myself.  I don't think it would take much to get this establishment out of the A-OK status of 3 stars for me.  If there was a variable I would go for 3.5.  I just think a few little things and considerations would help greatly.  Another thing now that I think about it - our first visit it was packed and crazy.  Today, just my son and I, another couple, and a few just off work employees hanging about.  Just seems something is going on that is keeping this place from being top notch and I'm not sure it is the management, although they are who can control and change things.  The place is clean.  The bathroom is clean - always a good sign.  Half the staff are friendly and seem happy and concerned about the place.  Some seem surly and act like they need another place to work.  One was obviously off work wearing a tank top and shorts and looking like he might have just worked out, kept staring at us and went behind the counter for something to add to his collection of items that were covering the little bar area over by the drink machine.  No big deal, but his actions are being mentioned because at any restaurant, you need everyone behind the counter to look professional and dressed similar to show who is working there and who can help you and there was a mish mash behind the counter and behind the grill.  Several have Rumbi shirts and look great - others in street clothes.  Just my opinion and my observation for what it is worth.  I really feel, especially judging from the other reviews, that the reason this restaurant seems to score mostly either 5s or 1s, with very few in between - check it out for yourself - is because of little things like this - some things bother some customers that might not bother others - but you have a real  love it  or  hate it  thing going on with this restaurant and that tells me it is definitely fixable and that any input, review, or observation should be helpful.  Thanks for your time.  My son says he enjoyed the burger and the fries and he thought it was good.

I always get the Bonzai burger from Red Robin, which is basically identical to this, so I had an idea of what I expected out of it. It was good. Patties were juicy and flavorful and the fries were really good. But the prices didn't seem justified in my head. A side of sweet potato fries will run you $3.50. After walking out spending close to $11, I felt like I could have been more satisfied getting that Bonzai burger for about the same price that comes with unlimited fries. The plates are even more pricey. An Alaskan salmon plate will run you $10.50-ish and the portion you receive is less than generous.  I give it three stars because although the food was good, the prices just don't justify the meal. I am willing to spend more money on food if it's worth it. Call me cheap but if I'm going to spend $3.50 on a side of fries, they better be off the charts or a bigger portion and these weren't quite there on either.", "Date": "2013-10-30", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Elizabeth", "ReviewID": "NmR0NgQTeBRfaqSvGmfAVA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "The food is great!

I am not too sure of the concept but they seem to offer Hawaiian food with healthier option. Menu was simple with few options of burgers, salads and rice bowls. Rice bowls are customizable and you get to choose rice/brown rice, along with different protein and sauce. I got the steak rice bowl which was $8 and some change for their half size. Portion was generous. Steak was cooked medium to well-done and came with steamed vegetables. I appreciated the fact that they put sauce on the side because I was able to put sauce to my liking.    I opted for their teriyaki sauce to go with my rice bowl, which according to the server is their most popular choice for sauce. It was sweet and a little tangy. I usually don't like too much sauce on any dish in general but I ended up using the whole container of sauce and still felt like I needed more flavor. I also wish that their steak was cooked more on the rare side than well done but that was probably my fault for not telling them how I wanted my steak to be cooked.   Service was slow but friendly. My rice bowl was freshly prepared but took a good 20 min to come out.

The salad that came with it was basic, but the veggies in it were bright and vibrant (so I know it's fresh!).

I saw they had a groupon deal and checked Yelp and decided to try it out. What a huge mistake. The Kahuna burger, my God, what an absolutely TERRIBLE burger. Pattys had absolutely no flavor whatsoever. The swiss cheese was not even melted and there was a very large amount of mayo on the burger. Every time I took a bite the entire middle of the burger would slide out of the bun because it wasn't melted. Now on to my biggest complaint; the fries. Their menu says something along the lines of  add Rumbi fries, chips, or a salad to any burger for $1.95 . So I order and say I want fries, expecting Rumbi fries. I get plain old fries, like at McDonalds. The amount of salt on these fries was unbelievable honestly. So when the cashier/server brought out the food I said are these Rumbi fries, I thought that's what I was getting. She said, and I quote,  You gotta tell me whatchu want. You said you wanted regular fries.  I just about lost it right there, but somehow decided to hold my tongue. First of all, for $1.95, the options are chips, Rumbi fries, or a salad. How in the world am I supposed to know that normal fries would be served when they aren't even an option? Had I been served the Rumbi fries I might not be so critical of the rest of the meal, but without them everything else was just so terrible. Yelp definitely led me astray and I seriously would not recommend this place to anyone. I am not even exaggerating, a Big Mac or Whopper have more flavor than the terrible Kahuna Burger.

When I checked in at Rumbi, Yelp popped up a  1 Free order of cookies  which I decided to cash in on and got a little bag of M&M cookies.  I took my table number to a corner table and realized there was free wifi with password (just ask them for the password when they bring your food). When they arrived with my food, I dug in. It was good and though it took me awhile to finish, because I was also doing homework, I finished everything and was happily stuffed. The employees kept coming to my table, as well as others, asking how was my meal which I liked. There are also clean bathrooms in the back of the restaurant.

I purchased a Groupon which gave me $16 worth of food for only $8(Which today 7/11/13 is still available!) . Today I forgot my lunch so I decided to go on my lunch break;  I ventured down Maryland Parkway to this restaurant. I normally go to Cafe Rio so this was a nice change.  Upon entering it is a somewhat island themed restaurant with really nice colors. I really like how they use the past out along with the dark brown wood for their seating. I looked at the menu and they had a plethora of different food selections that you could choose. Although I looked at all of the photos on Yelp and they all look delicious I decided on the volcano chicken sandwich with regular French fries and iced tea.  The volcano chicken sandwich is topped with Swiss cheese, cilantro Mayo, pineapple salsa, lettuce, and red onions. The chicken itself has a seasoning on it and is a rather large piece of chicken. It is perfectly grilled and placed in a delicious white bun. Now this bun is not your typical bun, it is a delicious artisan tight bun that is perfect for the large portion of chicken that they place inside of it , along with all of the garnishments that come on your sandwich.  I got to work and took my first bite and I was literally shocked. The chicken was so tender and perfectly cooked and juicy, I didn't even have to put salt on it. For those of you who know me, I put salt on everything even before I taste it, it's a very nasty habit, LOL.  The regular French fries or cooked perfectly and seasoned really well, I didn't try the  sweet potato fries  but they they looked delicious. I opted for a drink and the cup you get you can bring back and I believe its only $0.25 for a refill the next time you come. I chose the iced tea and I lemon, I really liked the tea, it tasted kinda like hibiscus or a mango, super yummy!!

So their franchise attention to paint, trim, decorations, quality signs and graphics was welcoming.  The cashier was friendly and I ordered food to go, which arrived in reasonable time on a Saturday afternoon.  The Voodoo Salad with chicken was a decent portion for $8, the tortilla strips were still crunchy when we got home, and I'm glad it had lots of feta cheese.  The sauce was sweeter and spicier than I expected.  The Teriyaki Chicken Kids Bowl was fantastic, and I'm going to recommend it for my gastric bypass friends.  $4 gets you a half cup of grilled chicken, a cup of steamed veg, and ton of white rice (but I adore rice, so I was in heaven.)  I like when the broccoli keeps some crunch, plus they added some celery.  The zucchini and carrots were soft steamed.  :-P  The sauce was super sweet and salty, so thumbs up.  My go-to place is usually Teriyaki Madness, but I'm glad to have found something similar close to home.  This place seems lighter, and they gave me a $3 coupon and punch card, which I'm a total sucker for (way to cinch that fifth star, guys!)  My only suggestion would be the smell in there.  It was ... buttery?  Oily?  Not something I'd want to order, and enough to notice.  Perhaps it was the cakes, which sorely tempted me from their gooey pineapple upside down cupcake signs.

I came here for a lunch as part of a fundraiser for a student organization. I ended up ordering a tofu spicy teriyaki bowl ($7.95) that came with white rice and veggies and a fountain drink (total $11 +change). The customer service was impressive at first - the cashier was abnormally friendly and the guy who brought me my food grabbed me a fork. Even though the cashier tried to up-sell me into buying pineapple cake for dessert, I still liked the guy.   It wasn't until I sat down and realized I had been duped! When asked for a drink, I replied with a simple yes. The cashier had automatically given me a large drink, so he up sold me there (though without my knowing consent). I hate when restaurants do this because I feel it's almost unethical. Ask me what size I want damn it! Or else I'll just assume you're giving me the regular size. I was peeved about that but didn't bother saying anything because I figured hey, the money is going towards a fundraiser. Remember to specify exactly what you want if you go to Rumbi's.  Now for the food: it was just okay. The veggies were overcooked, i.e, the broccoli had lost all its green color and was squishy to the max. The  spicy  factor I asked for was seriously lacking. Last, the rice was hard and crunchy, NOT soft and fluffy.   I probably won't come back to Rumbi's. :/ The restaurant has a 4 star rating, but I just didn't get that level of experience.

So I heard about Rumbi's grand opening through the BOGO coupon that my boyfriend had acquired earlier in the week. We decided to try it out since we were nearby UNLV and they are located just next to Rebelbooks.   ATMOSPHERE: Outside of the restaurant they had someone passing out samples of some kind of teriyaki flavored beef with rice. Very inviting. Inside, the Hawaiian-themed walls and decorations were nice and not at all reminiscent of the garish-colored Hawaiian t-shirts.  FOOD: Kind of on the expensive side if it not were for our BOGO coupons. The first time we went we had the Cabo Fish Tacos and the Kahuna Burger. Both portions were huge and full of flavor. The well-seasoned fish tacos had some kind of tropical salsa and came with coconut rice and the burger was juicy and the pineapple inside matched perfectly with the teriyaki sauce. The SECOND visit... Was not as good as the first visit however. This time we both tried their salads and was disappointed with flavor and portion sizes that matched the $8 price. The Aloha Chicken Salad had almost no flavor unless you drenched it in dressing, which I chose not to do. The Jamaican Jerk Caesar Salad was also bland, and that would be including the chicken and dressing.   SERVICE: The service the first week was great. A couple weeks later during our second visit, the girl at the cash register was very nice, but the guy manager seemed a little bit on the hurried side when answering my questions and didn't make me feel as welcome.  Overall, I say stick to the recommended burgers and the entrees, as they will be filling and satisfying.

I've been here twice; the first time I had the Luau Pork Sandwich, which is a kalua pig sandwich made with cole slaw. It was surprisingly tasty! I make kalua pig at home all the time, so I know what it should taste like. The second visit I had the Kahuna Burger, which is made with teriyaki sauce, pineapple, and some veggies. It was surprisingly tasty as well! For the burgers (which are pretty big), you have the option of ordering their Rumbi fries, which are crinkled sweet potato fries served with regular fries (I just wish the ratio of Rumbi fries to regular fries was higher). The sauce that comes with the fries is also very good!  The interior is bright, clean, and modern, with splashes of Hawaiian art, although the space is a bit on the small side. The staff is nice and very helpful. They were also very patient as we took our time deciding on what to order.  Overall, I give Rumbi's a 5 star rating based on the menu, the cleanliness of the restaurant, and the helpful staff.", "Date": "2013-08-15", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jinx Moo", "ReviewID": "tAyhB_mQKPG5LoNDm-PdkA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "First time here didn't know what to get. The dude working the counter was helpful. He even let me try a sample of their  rumbi rice.  (It's rice with some red beans cooked in coconut water) it was good. I ordered the pork bowl with brown rice. I checked in on yelp and I got some free tempura shrimp! The food came out fast. And I'm going to work on it now. It's a pretty good teriyaki bowl. Now I need to teach them a thing or two about  tempura   too heavy of a batter. But it was free, so who am I to bitch. Now I'm stoned so who knows if my tastebuds are in a generous mood, but I'm full and happy so life is good.", "Date": "2013-10-17", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
