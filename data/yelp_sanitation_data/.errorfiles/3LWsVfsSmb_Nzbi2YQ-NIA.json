Two minor things I didn't like:  color added to the planner giving it a bright red color.  Unnecessary in my opinion.  Second the Bhuna Gosht was a bit salty (my wife thought it was perfect), but this is something you can tell them when you place the order.

I've only tried 2 other Indian places in my Life both were in Vegas The first was India Oven and the second was Mount Everest. India oven was ok. Wasn't a big fan of that restraunt but then again I was also younger and not interested in broadening my horizons and trying different things. Mount Everest was really good their sweet rice was really yummy but they don't serve Garlic Naan anymore :( at lunch I believer so in comes Delhi.     We came at about 2 and there were 2 parties of people besides us eating here. They have the standard share of Indian offerings my favorite was the Chicken Makhani. It's probably my favorite Indian dish. It's super good especially with the garlic Naan. Free mango lassi with check in so that's also a plus.   Only thing I will skip next time is the Galub Jamun. It's a dessert. Little balls of I think bread in a almost diabetic coma sauce. It's wayyyy too sweet for me.   I hope you last Delhi India cuisine.

Delhi came recommended to us by a British friend who had spent two years in India as  the best Indian food I've had in America.  That's high praise from someone from the two Indian food capitals of the world (and perhaps having a palate more similar to an American than a native Indian)  The service was almost hilariously attentive since we walked through the door right as the place opened for dinner and it was all but empty.  I love a full water glass though, so even though being asked 10 times during dinner was a bit of an interruption, I can't complain.  I foolishly filled up on delicious samosas at the beginning of our meal, but they were so tasty I can't be sad.  The vegetarian dumpling curry we had was surprisingly tasty.  The cashews in the sauce added such rich, thick, depth of flavor.  It is one of those dishes that makes you think, yeah, this is what I'd eat if I were vegetarian, and I wouldn't miss meat one bit.  ...But, speaking of meat, the butter chicken was an absolute dream. I've never had such perfectly cooked chicken in a curry.  The naan was also on point with a yummy chewy top and a crispy bottom.   To sum up how good the food was, my dining partner and I ended up eating so much of it we promptly went home and took a nap.

The goat curry was quite good, but I don't think I could justify coming back for just that.

It is located not too far from the south end of the strip so location and accessibility was not a problem. Upon entering my first impression was that the place seemed pretty inviting. It was spacious with the buffet nicely spread out along the far end, tables nicely spaced apart so after having eaten in Mount Everest the previous day this was a welcome change.  The buffet again has all the standard items that you will find in an Indian buffet. Appetizers included tandoori chicken, vegetable pakodas (vegetable fritters) and samosa (puff pastry with potato filling). Entrees included butter chicken, goat curry, saag, rice, biryani and noodles. Desert included gajar ka halwa (carrot pudding) and kheer (sweetened rice pudding with milk). Taste wise what stood out to me was that everything was good but not great. Well the biryani and naan (provided fresh on the table) were both excellent but all the entrees were enjoyable but nothing popped out. The deserts could have been better. The gajar ka halwa cried out for some more mava (heavy cream) and the kheer for more sugar. Obviously they were made keeping the health conscience, not too sweet regulars in mind (another resturant which was full of locals).   Service was good, all our plates were cleared promptly and price wise it was $10.99 which is pretty much standard for Indian buffets.

Flavorful, very warm, aromatic, and massive in portion.   I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, the Garlic Naan, Steamed Rice, and the Aloo Tikki (Must be a minimum of $25.00 to order for delivery). Everything was packed clean and tight, no spills and no issues.   The Chicken Tikka Masala is one of their most popular menu options. Now I know why. Creamy, smooth, rich, and especially spicy (if you order it as such). A perfect consistency with large chunks of delicious chicken. The tomato is not overwhelming, the spices don't rule the flavor (saffron is especially nice), and the chicken has a great consistency. I ordered a side of steamed rice, which was incredible for the amount given at $3.00. I expected a tiny bowl, but instead received an entire 6 x 6 to-go box full.   The Garlic Naan is good. The flavor is not especially strong, it's incredibly soft, not insanely chewy, but chewy enough; great to have just alone as a snack. The portion is large enough to be split between three people or more, and the texture is fluffy with that infamous smoothness of naan. I would honestly prefer regular naan, but that doesn't mean the garlic isn't especially tasty.  The Aloo Tikki numbers in two for $3.00, both about the circumference of a tennis ball. They are thick potatoes cakes, with a smooth interior and an especially crispy exterior. A little on the heavy side, but still delicious. They come with two sauces, one of which is a very close relative of a green avocado salsa, and the other a thick, sweet brown sauce. I have no idea what they are. I prefer them mixed together, because the green is especially spicy and the brown is a little too sweet. Combining or dual dipping evens them out perfectly.  Overall, the meal impressed me. I'm full with so many leftovers for tonight. Everything was absolutely wonderful and the delivery was so quick and efficient. I feel horrible, by the way. I ordered delivery and gave the girl the wrong amount for a tip.

It is one of the better priced Indian buffets in town at 9.99. I came in and ordered the lunch buffet. The dining room is very clean and spacious. There is a large buffet area which is loaded with tons of food.  The yelp check in offer was for either a soda or one of their house made lassi's, basically, a yogurt smoothie. They have a sweet one, a salty one, and a mango one. I ordered the mango. It was SOOO good. The flavor was very mango-ey and it was silky smooth and had a nice mouthfeel from the yogurt.  As for the food, I would recommend anything! I especially liked their chicken, all of their versions of them were super tender. The goat stew was especially tasty as well. It wasn't too gamey and the sauce on it was fabulous! There wasn't anything on the menu that I didn't like.  One thing that I thought was kinda weak was their garlic naan. I found the taste to be a little bit bland. And for their noodle, milk dessert was a little bit too sweet.  Service was also kinda questionable. They seemed to start out pretty slow with taking our orders and getting our drinks, and after our first round of dishes they didn't clear our plates fast enough so that we were stacking our plates on top of each other. But, they were quicker at bussing our table during the middle of our dining experience.  Would I come back? Oh, you know it, because I loves me some Indian food.

Sadly no.  Do they serve the worst I've tried?  Far from it.  Simply put, Delhi Indian Cuisine is average if not slightly above.  I went with a group of Yelpers for a Sunday lunch buffet.  I was impressed by the overall number of dishes to try and found the $10.99 price to be quite fair.  Not being one to shy away from new foods, I tried a sampling of nearly all the options Delhi has to offer from meat dishes to vegetarian.  I even tried the curried goat, a protein new to me.  It wasn't bad but there was nothing about it that made me think  oh my goodness, this is awesome.  In fact, that is true for basically everything I tried.  There was nothing that I wanted to push aside but there was also nothing I wanted to go back up to serve up seconds of.  I had their chicken makhani and chicken tikka masala which are typically my favorites at an Indian restaurant.  Both were good just not spectacular.  My biggest disappointment was the saag paneer.  I got a nice healthy scoop of saag but had trouble finding the paneer.  Its a good thing I like creamed spinach because that is about all it was.  At least on my plate.  I did see others with paneer on their plates so maybe I just got the bottom of the barrel before it was refilled.  At the other end of the buffet bar, I did like the desserts quite a lot.  I tried and thoroughly enjoyed the galub jamun and the syrup those little dough balls are in.  There was a rice porridge or pudding of sorts that was tasty too.

I have my favorite spot for that food and I am just not messing with it. Indian lunch buffet is one such thing, but after hearing some love from trusted friends, I reluctantly shook up our routine and tried out this new spot.   It's a large open room so it's probably a better bet if you are dining with a large group as the other better buffets are rather small dining rooms. Size of the buffet is fairly good as there were 16 hot dishes, some chutney, lettuce, cucumbers, some fruit and kheer.   We got the garlic naan, which I thought was superb and had nice garlicky flavor.   All the food was solid, but there were a few standout dishes for me. Tandoori chicken was juicy and I appreciate these aren't huge hormone large pieces. The goat curry had a nice flavor in the sauce, though quite a bit of bones to navigate., Saag paneer was solid, a bit creamier than average. The one surprise for me is the malai kofta. In the past, I've disliked this dish at other places, but I loved it here because of the texture of the kofta. I find some places it just is dry and dough-y and full of blah, but the texture of this is soft and creamy even. There wasn't a label for it, but it was sort've cut up pieces of sausage similar to a lulu kebab that had a nice gingerly flavor to it that was awesome wrapped in naan with chutney. The yellow daal was really tasty - probably my favorite one I've had in the recent years.   I see that there are pics of the Himalayas and seen some mention of there being Nepalese owners and Indian owners so it's reflected in the way food is flavored. I find Napalese is less spicy and more a balance with savory and sweet.   Service was decent. We had our drinks refilled and the people were friendly. There's a current check in for a lassi or soda so we took advantage and got a free mango lassi which was yummy.   I think this matches my usual standby in quality so I'm glad we went. I think I will alternate between this place and Mint depending on the type of Indian I feel like having.", "Date": "2014-09-12", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Nancy", "ReviewID": "HVtAR60F5qvSJSyau1dQsA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Awesome food choices . the spice level was good as well .

It's taken the #1 spot in the Indian lunch buffet spot with one restaurant yet to go.  I was there early, about 11;15, and I was the first person in the restaurant.   There soon were several other customers.  It's a very large room with lots of tables laid out well and the buffet is a large area opposite the entrance.  With a check in on Yelp, you get either a mango lassi or a soda free.  It's a good deal for merely checking in.  I ordered garlic naan and then headed to the buffet.  The naan was good but I wish it had more of a garlic flavor.  For the first plate, I had chicken Biryani, a couple vegetable pakoras, a vegetable samosa, a piece of tandoori chicken, some chili chicken, soya badi, and some saag paneer.  Everything I had was very good and I noticed that almost all dishes had a spiciness that I liked.  Of these, the weakest dishes was the saag paneer.  The crust of the samosa was flaky and the filling was very good.  The soya badi was quite good.  For my second plate, I had squash, Navratan korma, chicken curry, and chana masala.  All of these were very good save the squash which was a little nondescript.  I also tried some of their raita which was good.  The chicken curry didn't have very much of a curry flavor but when the juices from the chana masala mixed with the curry juice, it became much better.  Finally, I went back and got one idli and put a small amount of tamarind chutney on it.  It had a soft texture and was good.  I was a but disappointed that they had no dhokla.  I had read Christopher S.' review and I was interested in trying something different.  Overall, this is a very solid buffet and moves to the top tier of Indian restaurants.  The price is now $10.99 but that's still very good considering the wide choice you have with their large buffet.  Service was very good!  Several times, someone stopped by to see how things were.  A woman stopped once and asked me if it was too spicy so they know that they spice their foods.  Plates were cleared before I came back each time.  This is another stop for after hiking when we go to an Indian buffet.

It wasn't too spicy. A little salty from the sauce, but good otherwise.        - Chicken Makhani - Chicken + Curry + Butter = Delicious. The chicken wasn't too dry and the curry was as buttery delicious as ever.        - Chicken Saag - I prefer the makhani, but this adds variety to my plate.        - Goat Curry - The goat is fall off the bone tender.

I wasn't expecting my taste buds to be delighted at almost every bite or for everything here to taste good and fresh, but that's pretty much what I got.  You know the rule of thumb about places that largely serve their own demographic, right? Well, I got really excited when I walked in and saw tables and tables full of Indian customers. It's such a huge place that I'd almost call it a dining hall rather than a dining room, and there were plenty of tables available for our group. Wish the lighting wasn't so dim, but that's a minor issue.  Naan, either standard or garlic depending on what you ask for (I think the garlic actually gets too soggy, but table majority ruled), is brought out by servers as needed. The rest of the food and condiments are in the buffet line. Starting from the front of the line, you run meats, veggies, and sauces/desserts. I'll just list what I had:  - Tandoori chicken: the one without sauce; luckily, only a little dry as opposed to the considerably or ridiculously dry fare at other places. - Chili chicken: reminiscent of some Chinese fried chicken offerings, but pretty sweet, not too spicy, and definitely fresh as opposed to what you might expect at an Asian buffet. - Chicken curry: can't recall the flavor exactly, but I'm sure it was good. - Chicken makhani: aka butter chicken, definitely a favorite of mine at Indian restaurants. Rich and delicious here as well. - Goat curry: tasty, somewhat fatty, typical gaminess of goat meat. Delicious. - Chicken biryani: chicken and rice dish, kinda sour but still not noticeably dry. - Vegetable pakora: a fried vegetable dish, wasn't very special but could pair with something like the saag paneer - Vegetable samosa: fried pastry stuffed with potato, good filling to crust ratio, crunchy on the outside and warm on the inside, not too spicy if at all spicy - Saag paneer: creamy spinach with cheese. Didn't even pick up cheese until round 2, so I was pleasantly surprised. Tastes good until you get really full.  Hey ma, I ate my veggies!  - Navratan korma: curry with cheese and potato, or at least those were the only two I fished out of the buffet tray. Pretty tasty, worth it even for meat-eaters like myself. - Tamarind sauce: sweet sauce that you can dip naan in. Helped to combat the sour taste when I accidentally bit into something unpalatably sour from the chicken biryani. - Mint sauce: light, and as minty as you would reasonably expect. I didn't really try pairing this with as many of the dishes as I should have, but I'm sure it would complement something well. - Gutab jamun: I probably have had this before, but I'll be darned if any place has made it this good. Great warm dessert dumpling in a sweet sauce. Wish I'd had room for more! - Kheer: rice pudding available next to the fruit, mildly sweet and probably should be eaten before you overwhelm your mouth with gulab jamun  I haven't gone out of my way to try every Indian restaurant around my hometown of San Jose or around the Vegas area, but Delhi Indian Cuisine serves through and through the best Indian food that I've had so far, period. The buffet thing is icing on the cake as it hardly detracted from the quality and was a tremendous value at $11.

I would have definitely given 4 stars for food and cleanliness, however there was a little something the servers did that I'm sure would annoy most people, but I'll get to that later. When we first came in, there were about 4 other parties seated. There was a lot of seating available and everything was kept nice and clean. We didn't get any menus, once we sat down, she told us we could start on the buffet. We didn't realize they were only offering a buffet for lunch but no problem. She also asked if we wanted fresh garlic or regular naan and if we wanted mango lassi. We went with garlic naan and skipped on the lassi just because we wanted to see how the food was first.  We basically tried all the meat options and many of the vegetarian options and there wasn't a single dish we didn't like. They all had incredible flavor and you could tell everything was really fresh and constantly having the temperature checked. Forgive me, I forgot basically all the names as I just started getting into Indian cuisine, Sorry! But everything was delicious. Now time for that annoying little quirk they had. They started passing out fliers to everyone to vote for them as Best of Las Vegas while everyone was eating. Okay no problem, I told them I would later since I mean I was basically mid-bite lmao BUT they wouldn't leave our table till I was like okay fine and pulled it up on my phone. And they were telling me how to vote and apparently you need an account to vote, then she grabs my phone, clicks login and tells me to enter my Facebook. I don't have a Facebook. Soo then she takes my phone again and tells me to create an account and just stares at me waiting for me to do it. Are you kidding me?? Ughh so I enter my info and it says it sent me and email confirmation. I kept checking and I never got an email..finally I tell her I'll call her over when I get it. She continued to check on me the rest of the time we were there and when we checked out. -_- Ya I know, I could of said no, but I didn't want to be mean. They should of never been so aggressive with it anyways.  Overall, food was amazing especially for $23 total (including tax before tip) and water was constantly being filled.

The owner Hari, comes from Tamba on the strip.   I was dining by myself so I went with the vegetable thali and mango lassi which is free if you check into yelp. My mango lassi was made in a blender at the bar so I could hear it being made from where I was sitting. The mango lassi was icy and tasted watered down. This was the first non creamy mango lassi I have had.   The samosa filling was well seasoned, not too greasy, but breading was a tad thick. It took 45 minutes for my vegetable thali to come. I am used to Indian restaurants being abnormally fast.   The presentation of the thali was classy and each dish tasted freshly made. My favorites were the malai kofta and the Kashmir sabji, the rest I could have done without. The malai kofta was well executed and the creaminess of the curry and aromatic spices worked harmoniously. First time I have had the Kashmir sabji and the assorted vegetables seasoned with herbs and spices pairs well with the richness of the malai kofta.    All the food I had was thoughtfully prepared and freshly made. Hari seems to genuinely care about his customers. After finding out i didn't like my mango lassi he made me another one without the ice.

First off, India Delhi has the second largest population in the world and projected to surpass China within the next ten years. China has fifty-three ethnic minority groups. Where as India has thousands of enthic groups each with their unique cuisine.  Delhi Indian Cuisine is operated by two families, one Indian and the other Nepalese. While Mt. Everest India's Cuisine on the westside is owned and operated by just one Nepalese family.   I have dined at many wonderful Indian restaurant all over the US. Buffets are for the general public to sample Indian cuisine and are usually available during lunch. Dinner is always much more satisfying and my preferred way to really sample many od India's incredible cuisines. I also think it's important to know which region of India the head chef is from. It's important since the seasoning and method of cooking will be greatly influenced by his region of origin.  I've pretty much have tried all the Indian buffets in town and I would rank Delhi Indian Cuisine's buffet equal to the spicier Taj Palace on Eastern Avenue and certainly superior to Mt. Everest India's Cuisine makeshift buffet counter. My review of Taj Palace is available. Mt. Everest India's Cuisine had failed to impress me in more than one way, and I didn't bother to place a review.   My most favorite Indian buffet is served at the beautiful Royal Taj of Hanover, MD.

I admit I didn't hold out much hope, but it's a cuisine of which we are mutually fond, and I figured we could find SOMETHING good on the menu.  Yee hah! Turns out they featured the ubiquitous lunchtime buffet, so we could try it all.  The tandoori chicken was surprisingly moist, the butter chicken rich and tasty, and the curry had a satisfying kick. There were lots of vegetarian options involving rice, lentils, spinach, etc., which I never got to. Not because I don't like them; I happen to believe that All Foods Matter, but I had slurped up so much sauce with that nice hot naan, that I had to tap out. Did manage to wash down a big glop of sweetened carrots that made a fine, if unintended, dessert.  Might have been a four star, but it's getting five because there was actual meat in all those steam table trays, not just the sauce with a few barely detectable chunks as is too often the case at Indian buffets.

My husband and I stopped in for their lunch buffet. A great selection, and all the food tasted fresh. I thought the particular standouts were the Goat Curry, the onion bhaji, and the garlic naan. I love goat, and of course its not easy to find in the U.S., and this is a staple on Delhi's buffet. Goat meat is a little stronger tasting than beef, and stood up to the sauce very well. The cuts of meat are on-the-bone...I wanted to dive in with my fingers and grab each piece and gnaw it clean!  The onion bhaji was crisp and tasty; not greasy at all. And the garlic naan was light and chewy and very, very fresh. I'm not a big fan of the bright yellow curry sauces, but my husband reported that the Punjabi curry was very good. The saag paneer was good also.. The tandoori chicken wasn't as highly spiced as I like, but it was moist enough to be tasty. Like the onion bhaji, the samosas were crisp, not soggy, and had a nice flavor. The biryani rice was a little greasy, but that was probably my only real nitpick with any of the dishes. They also have the standard side sauces, raita and mint sauce. We could have eaten those all day long, with baskets of naan! For dessert, there was warm carrot halwah (very tasty, but a little odd to us; not quite a side dish; not quite a dessert); and one other selection. You'll have to look for the  samia  (I've always known it as  kheer ), at the back of the salad table. It's not labeled as a dessert, and it's right next to the similar-looking raita sauce. If you aren't familiar with it, its a sweet milk and vermicelli-noodle pudding flavored with cardamom. I like mine with more cardamom, but this was a nice cool & sweet ending to a spicy lunch :-)  With one soda pop, our meal for 2 was about $25, and well worth it. Rather than cook just one main dish at home, we enjoyed being have a lot of good Indian food at one meal.

A few moments pass by and a gentleman with a really upbeat attitude came over and delivered a little snack while we waited for our food. When the food arrived , it looked amazing! The flavors were perfect along with the spice level that I had picked. I ordered the chicken tikka masala with rice and garlic naan. One garlic naan and white rice can be split between two people but the chicken tikka masala could not.  The restaurant has a promotion going on that says   free dessert when you check in on Yelp  my fiancé told our waitress that we checked in and she said we would also have to write a review. She stayed with our table to watch my fiancé write the review and she then gave us a choice between rice pudding or a pastry. The pastry tasted like a pancake with liquid sugar. It was really good. OVER ALL, the restaurant could use background music, and maybe a little better costumer service, but the food was perfect for the most part.

Well, this is the answer. Do not look at any other reviews because New Dehli is where you want to go.  Just a few months old, it has a slew of positive reviews and -- as great as the food was (there is a mango lassi free with your check in that you MUST get) -- the pride the staff/owners put into the restaurant is apparent with every detail of the restaurant. From the decor to the menu to the EXCELLENT service, New Dehli is what comes to mind (for me, at least) when we talk about  shopping local . This is their restaurant and I saw in my visit that the owners truly care about this place. These folks took out a space in a shopping center (plenty of parking!) and have created a truly sincere dining experience. Maybe it's not something I can explain well -- but if you'd like to understand, swing by New Dehli on a Thursday evening and take in the experience.

It was a bit of a drive across town for us, but we would soon discover that it was well worth the drive on this blustery night in Vegas. When we arrived it was rather quite with only a few tables of guests, but we were welcomed with a warm greeting that soon transformed into thorough service in their clean space with simple yet pleasing ambiance.  We took most of our server's suggestions after talking about our likes and dislikes. Most dishes have a spice range from one to ten. We opted to stay right in the middle and asked for some separate spicy sauce to add...the spice on the side was very spicy, just the way I like.  We ordered Garlic Naan, Nepali Vegetable Momos, Butter Chicken with dark meat, Lamb Dhansak, Baingan Bharta, and Mango Lassi. Dinner also comes with complimentary Papadum & Chutney. Everything was delicious and exotic.   My favorites were the Momos and Butter Chicken. The Momos are Nepali dumplings--folded fresh and juicy with curry dipping sauce on the side...I enjoyed these dumplings very much, especially the excellent wrapper of the Momos...not too thick and not too thin.  I am used to Japanese and Thai Curry but this Indian Curry was made of different layers of spices and full of great flavor. To cool it all down we had a Mango Lassi...made with Yogurt and Mango...yummy.

They were cool with making us Roti (whole wheat) instead of regular Naan, and I thought the size of the Tandoori Chicken pieces was encouraging.

On a recent trip to Vegas, a friend recommended I leave the strip (its like 3 blocks away so not that far I guess) and eat at Delhi. I love Indian food so I gave it a shot. If I didn't like Indian food before, this would have sold me for sure!   The food was a solid 5/5. We had the butter chicken and the malai kofta. We also started with some classic somosas. Everything was fantastically delicious. The somosas were crisp and yet fluffy on the inside. The butter chicken was a little spicy, creamy, and melt in your mouth all at once. The kofta was a dish I had never tried before but was pleasantly surprised because the curry it was in was the best curry I have had to date. We topped it off with garlic naan and life was perfect.  The servers were always attentive. This is the kind of place where you will never see a water glass empty. To be fair, we were one of two parties dining at that time (they had just opened for dinner 2 minutes prior to us arriving) so mileage may vary.  Finally, the price was most definitely right. That entire meal I described came out to like $40 which left me and my gf who I was eating with bursting at the seams.

They serve you small portions dishes, plus rice, naan and a yogurt dip. Such a great deal to try new food. The menu said dessert was part of it but it never came. Out of all the dishes the only one that he didn't like was the lentils. Was too salty. Not sure it that's how it's supposed to be or if it just got over seasoned.    I ordered whipped spinach with cheese, and goat curry at a spicy level of 7 andJeera Rice( if you never had this before, I HIGHLY recommend this)  and of course garlic naan. What came to the table was different. I got a different goat dish instead of the curry ( tomato base that was thin and soupy) and with very little spice. (My boyfriend order his spice lever at 5 and was stronger than my dishes)  new cook, different cook, waiter miss heard me??  I didn't complain because I hate that at restaurants and didn't want to waste the food. It was still good ( not amazing like last time but again, I got the wrong dish) different chef, off night?

But I think I would pay the extra few dollars and go a block over to Mint in a heart beat. Yes the buffet takes up length wise over half the restaurant, but what I didn't care for about this place was that it lacked variety - you have the standard Tandoori chicken, Tikka Masala etc.  But maybe it was a busy day before I got there giving them the benefit of the doubt, but I had to fish around in the sauce to find pieces of chicken and not only in the tikki masala but any dish which contained sauce and meat. Don't get me wrong I love sauce, but I like to find that there is ample meat to accompany my sauce.   Also, there was something about the ambience that felt cold - maybe it was the poor acoustics which made it feel very big and open but not in a good way or the just the set up but somehow the dining room was not overly inviting. Although, that in itself is not something that would normally concern me - hey if the food is superb I'll eat it sitting on a street corner (as used to be the case with Viva Las Arapas before they moved). Nonetheless, I thought it is something that should be noted.   Service was average, nothing outstanding. We did request garlic naan and they brought it. My friend asked for lemon wedges for water, they forgot, had to ask again and then they brought a plate of lime wedges from the salad bar.. maybe they don't have lemons?   On the upside I got a free Mango Lassi which was tasty with Yelp check in - so thank you Delhi Indian Cuisine for that treat.

The staff was solid for a buffet as in those 45 minutes I had my drink refilled about 5 times. They also cleaned up our plates before I got back from each trip the buffet line  They also had this spice mix when you leave up front that was full of spices they used like dinner mints which was cool to try.  I like the value, the restaurant staff, the decor, and definitely the flavors. For $35 after tax for three people it's an excellent value and I'll return very soon.  Chicken tikka masala that is comparable is about $15 at most establishments on its on so this was awesome.", "Date": "2014-11-16", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Devika", "ReviewID": "1V-ePvMM-piqtmFHdBy3jw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Great buffet!

I went a few weeks ago for the buffet, and as buffet goes I think this one is one of the stand outs.  I loved each curry I tried, where in alot of places flavor does not separate  each dish. But for each choice at Delhi Indian Cuisine, I could taste a different recipe.  I also had the mango lassie.  It helped anytime i had a super spicy curry.  The only downside was that it was such a small glass. Honestly I would drink a gallon of lassie if they served it to me.  The selection was great, I really though the naan and the tandori chicken was the best I have had in a while.  And to finish off a perfect buffet lunch, the mango custard was amazing.

Pretty much all of its rivals are in little strip malls of varying degrees of  decay, so this should not deter you in terms of its exterior.  Once you step inside, the modern decor with track lighting, single open room layout, and seemingly endless linear display of offerings along the buffet line should set your mind at ease.    Upon being seated, you are immediately prompted if you would like naan bread with your buffet.  Not only should you say yes, but you should specifically request the garlic naan since the aroma alone with the freshly minced garlic and finishing brush of ghee emanating from the freshly cut bread removed from the tandoori oven is intoxicating enough to get your appetite revved up on the feast that lies ahead (refills are complimentary if you need more)  As one approaches the buffet line, the first wave of offerings include various meats including the standards such tandoori, tikki masala, and curry chicken along with some wild cards such as goat curry and reshmi kababs, which is a ground chicken meatball that seems a bit healthier than the sauced meats.   The latter half of the line offers a multitude of vegetarian offerings including saag paneer (spinach), chana masala (spicy stewed chickpeas), eggplant, mixed curry veggies, and lentils.  The third category of offerings is the carbs, which in this case included plain basmati, a spicy chicken biryani, mini-samosas (which gives you more of the flaky crust to enjoy, much like why mini-pecan pies are superior to regular pecan pie), idli (a steamed rice cake), and something I've never seen before, a spongy savory cake called dhokla, which I've read to be a beloved street snack in the southern part of India.  It has a cornbread-like consistency, a rich yellow hue from turmeric and mustard seeds, and is served with some chili peppers, cilantro, and toasted coriander seeds.  Add a dollop of tamarind, and it is a pretty addictive combo of flavors which I would have had more of had I not discovered it at the end of my meal.    I almost never have room for desserts after an Indian buffet but it is a rotating mix of gulab jamun(sweet milk balls), rice pudding, gajar halwa (carrots+milk), and a few offerings of fruit which I am always a bit wary of when it comes to buffets in general.    Service was very good in which plates were cleared and water was refilled efficiently, and the staff checked in a few times to see how I was enjoying the meal.  Compared to the local competition, price point is excellent (9.99 vs 10.99 at India Masala, and 12 and up at Mint and Gandhi), quality of food is definitely in my top 3 in Vegas (Mount Everest and Taj Palace), and highlights include the garlic naan, balance in offerings between vegetarian and meat dishes,  a few unique offerings (mini samosas and dhokla), and ambiance.  India Masala is still my go-to choice for take out buffet due to quantity (refer to my review for my patented packing technique) as well as complimentary Mango Lassi with yelp check-in, but if I'm dining in, Delhi Indian is my new go-to place for quality when I plan to go on an Indian carb feeding frenzy for lunch.", "Date": "2014-02-12", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Tyler", "ReviewID": "5bKEFJB97WRyvJvZN88luQ", "Overall": "4", "Content": "This place truly surprised me. I took advice from a fellow Eliter on this place. I'm totally glad I did. I'm totally not one for Buffets but this place had really fresh food. None of the food tasted like it's been sitting there a while. A lot of buffets run into that problem.   Lunch buffet was all you can eat for $9.99. Great deal!  Restaurant was big and spacious so you aren't on top of one another. Service is meh. The servers really don't know the food too well. I was quite nervous eating there because I have a tomato allergy. Server didn't know the sauces too well so I had to be selective on what to eat. Sucks but at least I was smart in my food picking. I asked the server what was in the sauce like spices and such and all he kept saying was  it's cream based  over and over. Like I get that but what else is in it???? At least go ask a manager or a cook?!  Malai Kofti (fried vegetable balls in sauce) was my favorite part of the meal. A sauce unlike I have had in a while with yummy fried veggies in it. All around amazing.  The vegetable Samosa I expected more. The flaky part was ok but the vegetable middle wasn't what I was expecting: I just dipped it in the Malai Kofti sauce and it tasted better lol  Basmati rice was simple like most places.

The goat curry was fantastic. They had a wide variety of lassis including strawberry, cherry and lychee which the kids enjoyed. We ordered all of the dishes mild for the picky eaters in our group but I was happy to find that some dishes were more on the spicy side. Usually have to order extra rice and naan but the portions here were good sized and ended up with leftovers.

I keep coming back to Delhi and its becoming my new favorite indian restaurant in town.   It seems this place must do the majority of business during their lunch buffet because each time we have dined in the evening it's been dead. I don't mind a quiet restaurant...actually I prefer to feel like I have a restaurant all to my self but it makes me worried that somehow this restaurant is hurting. I hope not! I would hate to see another great Indian restaurant close.   The service here is great, the owner is always floating around and managing every aspect. You can tell he is passionate about his restaurant and it really shines through the service and food.   The Food  Chicken Tikka Masala Amazing. Perfect balance of cream, tomato and masala spices. Not too oily and great depth of flavor. Chicken is succulent and juicy, only gripe is there is not enough chicken but I deal with it because their sauce is that good.  Naan Airy pockets with doughy edges and just the perfect amount of seasonings. Heavenly! Always so fresh and so darn addicting and their garlic version is a standout.   Tandoori  Have tried both chicken and shrimp. By far my favorite was the shrimp. I've always preferred a shrimp tandoori anyway because there is nothing more visually appetizing than large juicy shrimp and fresh onions and lemons sitting atop a sizzling hot plate. Those sexy soft hissing and popping noises get me every time.    Matter Paneer  Well I have had better IMO but it wasn't bad. I think it's too forward with tomato and I'm searching for more creamy notes. Which is silly when you think about it, there is paneer in there and that should somehow be enough, maybe a touch more cream would make it better? I don't know.   Malai kofta  Sauce 10! Dumplings 0! Way too dense and I like when they are shaped into round balls instead of those football shaped things. I'm totally just whining here, shape shouldn't matter but the shape coupled with how dense they were just didn't do it for me. But that sauce though! Their cashew based sauces are amazing.   Gulab Jamun Again another too dense item but I don't hold that against them. I've experienced the same dense issue at other restaurants regarding this dessert. Maybe was cooked or sitting too long? Not sure.  Mango lassi Dare I say this was made with canned mango? I hope I'm wrong here but I'm pretty sure it wasn't fresh mango. Still tasty nonetheless especially as the alcoholic version.

The staff was very knowledgeable and able to answer our every question.   The food? It was delicious!! No complaints on my end. The Butter Chicken was very well rounded. Nice and creamy curry, soft and moist chicken; put that on top of rice and you get a wombo combo! The complimentary Papadum was something else: the bread was nice and crispy, add one of the two sauces that came on the side and you get a sweet taste (black sauce) or a earthy savory taste (green sauce). We also ordered the Sev Puri which was a whole mouth full of flavor. The house made cracker was nice and crispy topped off with what seemed to be a jumbled yet organized mess of toppings and you get a nice high note of sour and spicy and a slight saltiness.

They had chicken tandoori (flavorful!), goat biryani, channa masala, and the list can keep going on and on. We also ordered garlic naan (including in the 10$ buffet price) and it honestly seemed to come right out of the oven! I couldn't get enough of the chicken tikka masala, and the Navrata korma (I think that's the name? LOL). The sauce (Salan) was creamy and hot.   It became obvious that this place is going to be very popular VERY soon. We talked to the owner, and he was very helpful. He told us that although the main items stay the same during the lunch buffet, sometimes the dessert (mithai) might change, and maybe the lentil curry (daal).

Extremely disappointed. Food was OK at best. Tandoori chicken was cold and dry, It got finished and was not replenished for 30 mins. Till then we were done. They serve bread (naan) fresh on the table. Great. We were 4 adults. Gave us 2 naans, one garlic and one plain. We didn't know the type till we were done with the top garlic one. We asked for another garlic naan and our unfriendly waitress refused till we finished all the naans. As is in dictatorship you have to follow what the Govt says so here we have to obey with the instructions. When done, we asked for Garlic naan and for a change she smiled and left to get replenishment. We waited for as long as we could reminding her but with little success. Finally after a long wait we got the naan (1 piece) only to discover that it was not properly cooked and raw dough was coming in our mouth. Called the waitress and she quickly took our naan away never to be seen again. At that point we were disappointed and done. Paid our bill and left the place vowing to never return.  My wife paid the bill as me and kids were freaking out because of poor quality of management and lack of food. She complained to the manager who had following reasons. Got too many people, staff ran away, 3 weeks ago there was rain in Las Vegas that they are recovering from etc.. However we had to pay full price for the food while they all messed up. Our waitress was very unprofessional and would run away when before we could finish asking her a question. I had once asked her to listen patiently. She was rude or may be helpless.

I started going to this place about 2 months ago , had a gigantic biryani and mango lassi , the chef specializes in the Mango lassi as far as I am concerned! Fan ever since . First time I went there for the buffet , the garlic bread , the mushroom were fantastic , not to mention the chicken and mutton .I had a feast , no pun intended . Only regret that day was, maybe  I shouldn`t have eaten that much .But by another 3 days the regret vanished and i duly returned ,this time ,they had another special variety of chicken , I am blanking on the name , but i was good , if you end up there just look and sausage like chicken roll,it`s really good .  When I am not going to this one ,I am probably going to some other one :) .Imagine the embarrassment at showing up at the same buffet ,every other day ! And have to say most of them are similarly priced and probably have similar food range ,but after multiple sampling at other indian buffets I have to say that this one has more options,maybe a little bit cleaner and definitely the most spacious  in town. And would recommend it to anyone who wants to get away from ridiculously priced buffet at the big nightclub restaurants , as long as you like indian food . As for the negative stuffs , the ambience could be better , i mean they could decorate the walls a little bit better and play some decent music like some upscale places.Sometimes they have hard time catching up with the demand supply thing but i guess this being a new place ,its something they can work on.And  yes sometimes ,there is just that little extra oil floating around in the nan-bread or the curries, again something they can work on .All in all ,for an indian buffet ,it`s bang for bucks.

There were some items I liked and some that I didn't, but nothing wowed me.   The sitting area is large and they can hold a good volume of people. The staff was nice, but a little disorganized. We had to let a couple people know before we actually got our naan. The ambiance is very casual and it makes for a nice lunch place.  In the appetizers, the Tandoori Chicken was cold on the outside from sitting out so long and only tasted okay. The Shish Kabob was tasty, but not one of the kinds that I could keep eating. I had a couple pieces and was done. The Samosa, I would rave about. Though the filling had a little too much peas for my taste, they were really yummy. In most samosas, my favorite part is the little end where there is no filling and the dough is crunchy, and in this samosa, all of the dough tasted like that edge piece. Simply wonderful!  One really good thing about this place is that they deliver fresh naan to your table. Other buffets have the naan cut up as part of the buffet, but when there isn't a high turn around, you know those naans have been sitting for a while. Not the case at this place, they offered us plain or butter, but we asked for garlic and they obliged. It did take a little while for the naan to actually come out after we had ordered it, but it more than made up for the wait with the quality.   The main dishes is where I was most disappointed with this buffet. Chicken Makhani was pretty good. It had good layers of flavor. Unfortunately, at they tray seemed like the chicken pieces were either very small or had been picked through by other guests. The Chicken Curry had no flavor, and I only ate a little. There were a couple of vegetarian options, which was good to see for the vegetarian folk out there. I'm not a fan of brinjal, so I didn't try that, but I did try the Chana Masala, which was decent, although, not my favorite. All in all, there was nothing super exciting in terms of the main dishes.  For desert, I tried both the Gulab Jamun and the Kheer. The Kheer wasn't sweet enough for my taste. The Gulab Jamun, on the other hand, was pretty spot on. They were nice and warm too!

We were visiting Las Vegas for the 1st time and the friend really wanted to eat Indian food. So this place was the best choice to eat from the order restaurants.   The location was pretty easy to find. Although if you are coming from the side it can be a little difficult because the restaurant is hidden in the back corner. The server was pretty quick... too quick I say. She would come around and grab my bf's plate 1st before asking  are you done?    *sigh; honey you gotta ask if they're done before you take it*   The buffet in my case was pretty good. I like the chicken masala, to me it was good. The spinach (saag paneer but without the cottage cheese) * I think * had a little weird taste to it. The lamb dish was kinda hard and over cooked. The soup was pretty good (can't remember the name of the dish). The chicken tandoori was severely burnt and lacked spice and flavor. Samosas (vegetarian) were pretty good. They had a slight kick to them,which I liked.   From the guys side, they didn't like it. They say the chicken  was over cooked. The saag paneer was mixed with milk and it tasted bad. The Naan was dry, hard and slightly burnt but the dessert was okay ( the guys say it was the only dish that was good because it was brought rather than made). Overall if you're not a food analyst  will love it! But if you are one then  enjoy .  Also the manager doesn't really care about its customers, he could have at least asked if the food was alright, instead like most business people, Money 1st (pay 1st) ask questions maybe later.... or never.", "Date": "2016-07-08", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Saketh", "ReviewID": "Te7OYcbIMZkcSGLg4iqBoA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "The Guy Krishna, was awesome, Food is really nice and Good..!!

Only sad thing is that they do not consistently have kheer which is my fav. (4) service: always pretty good - water glasses are filled consistently (4) value: for $11.99, the lunch buffet is a great value - good for groups due to the large dining room (4).  This is our new go-to Indian Buffet joint in town. Sporting a good variety of items, they offer both Nepalese/East Indian flavors. The dining room is spacious and is capable of serving large groups of people comfortably.  Service is usually pretty good and your water glass is never left unfilled.  My favorite items include the saag paneer, chana masala and the aloo gobi. So delicious and usually always there. Their raita is nice and thick. They do not have chutney available as a condiment however the tamarind sauce does okay in a pinch. The tandoori chicken is quite moist and tasty as well. The hubs is addicted to their butter chicken and daal.  Their naan is great - loved the crispy bottom with the slight chew. Order it with garlic at no extra cost. Awesome!  Their one weakness in my opinion are the desserts. They have a rather artificial, watery mango  custard . This is in rotation with the vermicelli payasam which I found to be a bit too sweet and one note. I kind of miss the kheer using rice pudding and cardamom.

If you can read more than one word, then read on my friend cause this is one of the best Indian restaurants that I've been to.   Some hobknobs might find the location a bit shady, but the interior of the restaurant is clean and well put together and makes you forget about all the bums across the street. Whataraya gonna do? Amirite?  This place has only been opened a week or so. The service here was good. While the waiters were new and seemed untrained in the usual customer service/waiter chatter, (family owned restaurant I assume?), they were still very polite and attentive, and boxed our food to-go for us. No complaints from me, they refilled my water glass often as I slew down all that spicy curry.  Good news for all vegetarians, half the menu is vegetarian based, which put me in a chipper mood right off the bat when we entered. They also have multiple chicken and lamb entrees if you're still craving the meat food. For me not actually being a big fan of curry, the food was amazing and I ate till I was beyond stuffed. I forgot the names of the dishes we selected, but I had a nine vegatable combo with mild spicy creme curry and my boyfriend had the traditional chicken curry. Both were just right in hotness and didn't leave a chalky taste in my mouth like most curry does.  The grand finaleeeee....Naan bread. mmm yes, that's right. the garlic naan bread here is so delicious I just wanted to go adopt a new puppy or something. Was so good that I got another frisbee shaped bread slice to-go.  With all that and an extra bowl of rice, the price for two was pretty decent.

It was forever before she finally brought my drink and when she did it was the wrong cocktail. I explained it was a goose and side of fresh lemon juice the first time. She brought out a goose and a fresh lemonade.  When I told her it was wrong she totally copped an attitude with me, then went back to the bar only to make another wrong cocktail which was goose and a lemon soda!   When I told her she got it wrong yet again she told me she's never had somebody in there like me and she started yelling in her native language to another of her associates... and clearly it was about me lol    Then someone came out of the kitchen, we believe it was an owner, and started accusing her of stealing keys.  It turned into an all out screaming match in the middle of the restaurant.  I mean take it outside!  The cooks even came out of the kitchen to get ring side seats, eagerly awaiting the blood shed.   Our friend finally arrived in the midst of the insanity. It was like an episode of cops was unfolding before our very eyes.  We exited the establishment post haste.

What I noticed was how big this place was. My go to place for Indian is Everest, but my friend told me to try this place and I did.  The service is quiet but friendly and very quick. I give the food a 3-3.5 star but the service moves it over.  Ok, stop your yammering Andrew. What about the grub? The food is actually spicier than most other Indian restaurants I been to. The butter chicken is probably the tamest entree there. Well, that and the pre-requisite tandoori chicken. My favorite go to is always tandoori chicken and goat. And that's what I went for. The tandoori chicken was pretty dry. I wasn't sure if it was the Hoover Dam drought effects but i shrugged that off and notched it against Delhi. The goat is very tender and tasty. The butter chicken is very delicious. I also had the other spiced chickens like curry. It was good but not memorable enough for me to remember much about that foul. The eggplant was cooked well but man oh man it had some spice to it. A bit too much for a rather bland vegetable if you ask me. Sometimes the veggie is best left natural with a bit of seasoning. To me, this is one of them.  My regular rice pudding dessert was a bit different, it had vermicelli noodle bits in it....glass noodle for the noodlers out there. The fruit and desserts were minimal. If you like sweets, they had this glutinous ball that was swimming in honey water. Sweet and delicate. Try it.  I did not eat the different varieties of rice there but it looked good enough. The nan bread was brought out piping hot and had garlic and cilantro in it. It was fresh and tasted great, especially after dipping it in the butter chicken sauce.  AYCE lunch was about $10. There is quite a variety but I think I will stick closer to home and go to Everest.  Business seemed pretty slow so I hope it was because we lunched at 1:30.  I will mention one more thing. There were a little too many black things in the rice pudding. Maybe 2. Imma tell myself that it was some sort of spice. It wasn't a bug. I rubbed it on the table and it was more like lint. A bug would break apart. The better half thinks it's spice so I'll go by that. She did notice that it had quite a bit of it on the tray as well. I am Chinese but an extra added bonus of tiny bug is persona non grata.", "Date": "2016-03-31", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Mimi", "ReviewID": "qBtXKnIb4Y-5zFG-kPFxNg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Really good food and nice environment.

The menu contained numerous items that were new to us, and we started things off with a Mango Rum Lassi. The alcohol was a nice addition and did not overpower the sweetness of the lassi. For my main course I had the  Kadhai Paneer and enjoyed every bite. My wife had the Chicken Xacuti. I'll let her write about that in her review (she liked it). We shared the kashmiri naan and used it to scoop up the great food.   Would love to come back for the buffet.  Side note, be careful in the parking lot, there was a taxi that flew by us not once but twice and darn near hit our rental car. :\", "Date": "2015-12-29", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Spencer", "ReviewID": "1F0qz4eK4wUqVcx50J0pAQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Great dishes for Vegan folks.

There are white tablecloths with white paper tops, and lots of booths. The menu is varied with lots of choices for vegetarians and those looking for healthy food. My fish curry had some serious capsaicin authority, and I had ordered it as a 3 spiciness on a scale of 1-10. So if you don't appreciate spicy food, order it mild, mild, mild. My vegetable samosas were spiced perfectly, but my son would have complained that they were too spicy. I really liked the buckwheat roti (like a pancake).", "Date": "2016-01-06", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Kaitlin", "ReviewID": "k6KaKK8JicyxDZE5UrOLCQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Excellent service, delicious food, and reasonable prices.

The stuff's addicting, like crack well not really. Why didn't I know about Indian food when I was going to school.  Anyways Delhi Indian Cuisine is the latest Indian restaurant in my rotation. It's located in a plaza on the NE corner of Flamingo and Maryland between Toys R Us and Albertsons. Of course you have to do the lunch buffet I think it was $10.99 which is about the same price for everyone else, you might find someone doing it for $9.99. The food here is delicious, not my favorite for taste but maybe a close 2nd with the other business one block over. Forgive me but I don't know what all the dishes are but I love the green stuff, the orange stuff, the reddish stuff, and the chicken stuff. Nah I'm kidding, almost but I'll pretty much eat everything they have to offer, the tandoori chicken, the chicken tikka masala, the chilli chicken, the goat curry, the saag paneer, the garlic naan, the gulab jamun, etc. Well almost everything, I still haven't tried the chow mein yet.  It does seem like it can hold a lot of people, you could throw a party,  and it has been very busy each time I've been there. They have booths and tables. Customer service is alright they do seem to be shorted handed and do take a while to do thinks like getting the garlic naan.  They have check-in offer of a free soda or lassi. Each time I've been there I've asked them for the lassi but they've yet to brought be one. Good luck on getting your. Dammit I see that a lot of you are getting yours.", "Date": "2014-11-25", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jim", "ReviewID": "M3oY4jg76iRtelhWB3qQ4g", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Another  5 star review that everyone isn't sure of right?! No, this is the real deal. The food is excellent. My wife and I had dinner off the standard menu and we asked for several dishes and we know indian food. How do we know indian? We were taught by an Indian from Goa who knew many dishes and taught us how to cook northern, delhi, goa, and southern styles. My wife has cooked indian, made the paneer, made the yogurt, crushed the spices, everything. So we know how it should taste and the regional spices. So what did we try? We had vegetable samosa chaat with mint sauce and tamarind d sauce. They also brought papadom. We then had Rogan Josh, Navratan Korma, Goat Vindaloo, Mutter Paneer, plain parathas, and plain basmati rice. Every dish was authentic and provided in nice portions. The dinner was capped by galub jaman which was very light and fresh and the syrup was light and sweet. If you like indian, you won't be disappointed. If you want to try it, they will scale the heat from 1 to 10...don't be afraid it will be too hot! The owners are one family from Nepal. We were served by Krishna and Ashmati who were informative and met our wishes exactly. I love indian food and this restaurant is incredible...please, just go!", "Date": "2015-04-21", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
