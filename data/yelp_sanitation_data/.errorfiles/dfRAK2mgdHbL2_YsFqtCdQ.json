What a night that was.  The show was supposed to start at 9:00.  It started closer to 10:00 with local band Kreep.  They were great.  The sound was aweful but that was no fault of the band.  They were getting frustrated by it and had to cut their set short.  This sentiment was echoed by the next band (whose name is not worth remembering) and the headliner, the legendary and surprisingly unknown Anvil.  When all was said and done, I had been taken from Monday evening to the early hours of Tuesday morning.  It was a crazy fun night.  I love a good rock show.   The sound may have been horrible.  The air may have been saturated with cigarette smoke.  The drinks may have been pricey.  The point is, it was a fun and intimate setting for such music.  By intimate I mean small enough that there is a very real chance you will get to meet the bands and have a drink with them.  I met Kreep through a mutual friend.  He met Anvil by staying a while after the show.  If you are a metal head like me.  If you appreciate the unknown garage rock sound.  If you don't mind a somewhat dirty and sketchy environment, by all means check out Cheyenne Saloon.  It can be fun.

So far I've only been here once but I definitely had a great time and I'll definitely be back! Huge Fosters cans were $5 which I thought was a pretty good price during a show.

The only time I go to the Cheyenne Saloon is for shows, particularly underground metal shows. During my time of 2 1/2 years here, I seen performances from Sadistic Intent, Monstrosity, Master, Vital Remains, Dreaming Dead, Goreaphobia, Deceased, Gravehill, Diabolic... all of which are well respected in the metal community. Now back to my review.   I think this place is perfect for shows. Personally, I like a bar setting for shows. I'm also not a fan of the stage being close to the entrance, not the case here at the Cheyenne. I'm not too sure about their bar prices because I don't drink when I'm going as just me and when I do drink, it's more of me to congregate in the parking with fellow show goers with store bought beer. The bouncers there are pretty laid back and not too critical when the place gets rowdy up front.   My only gripe with this place is the smoke and pool tables. This place gets pretty smokey and your clothes stink after wards. As for the pool tables, they could use some leveling. I would comment about the bathrooms but do you really expect a nice bathroom in any bar that has these type of shows?   Words of advice. Bring your ID, you will be carded.

You can find a full schedule on their myspace (thecheyennesaloonlv).  When I came here to see a punk band, I was expecting to have my ear drums blown out (pretty common when bands play inside small bars).   I was pleasantly surprised when I noticed that the sound isn't painfully loud in here.  If you're standing by the bar, or in the billiards area, you can actually have a reasonably normal, and mostly audible conversation while a band is on.   Another shocker?

Yeah, it's a little dive bar, but that's exactly what I expected. The sound is pretty good, they have pretty decent specials on your standard beers  and the bartenders didn't try to act too hip to serve you. There are a few pool tables and a kitchen, too (pizza, I think).  That's about all you can really ask for, in my opinion. I dig the separate, sunken area in front of the stage too. It keeps the pit contained and allows an extra couple of feet viewing space for people a little farther back.  It seems to be mostly smaller/local, hardcore metal bands, so if that's your thing, I recommend this place. Again, a dive bar in a sketchy shopping center, but a really good place to see a smaller-level metal show.

A friend's hubby is in a band, and they frequently perform here, so I came here for two of his shows.    Wow, this bar is roomy!  I am used to cramped dive bars, but this place is quite large, with lots of room even away from the  concert floor .  They have a couple pool tables and a couple of arcade games, though those tend to be blocked by an engineering booth during live shows.  There is a pit in front of the stage which acts as a concert floor.   I can't comment on the drinks since both times I came I was a sober driver.  The sound is crisp and clear, and while it is a smaller music venue the audio never feels like it's going to blow your eardrums to South America.  If you stand near the bar or pool tables, you can even have a reasonably audible conversation.  Shows do have cover, but the prices are very reasonable, and you can often get presale tickets for less if you know anyone in the bands.  I do have one large pet peeve with shows in this venue: they never start on time!  They go by what I have effectively dubbed  Cheyenne Saloon time , in that all shows start one hour AFTER their scheduled start time.  The second time I came here, my friend's band was third on the lineup, and the first band started just after 10 PM.  They eventually went on at like 1 in the morning, and by then we were all burnt out and just wanted to go home (the second band was awful, and were on stage for about an hour compared to most other bands who play for around 30 mins).  Please start on time!  Secondly, since I wasn't drinking alcohol, I wanted an energy drink.  They didn't have Red Bull, but they had some generic brand that I never heard of.  The can still cost five or six bucks!  Are you kidding me?  Some of the domestic beer costs less than that, and it's not even Red Bull!  Non-alcoholic drinks SHOULD NOT cost as much as an import brew.  Makes it harder to want to be a DD, le sigh.  By the way, someone scratched a passage from the Book of Revelation in the bathroom, and it's filled with typos.  That's annoying to this English major, so fix it!  Personally, I don't like watching concerts in bars, preferring an exclusively music venue like The Farm, but it still is a good place to catch a show, and I will probably find myself coming here again for other shows.  PROS: Big and roomy for a dive bar Clear audio that doesn't sound too loud or distorted.   Good setup for shows  CONS: Generic energy drinks are pricey for this DD! You'll come out smelling like a human sized Malboro Shows start late!    THE VERDICT:  Good live music venue, but not a favorite of mine.

They don't have a great beer selection by any means unless you favor the more commercial pisswaters, such as bud, bud-light, bud-extra-light...lime? Anyway...  When bands play live, the sound system that they have don't do them any justice. Pentagram played there recently and even Bobby Liebling complained quite a few times during their set. Every band I come to see complain about the horrible sound  system  they have to endure. The way they handle shows is not the greatest, with promoting, the amount they charge, the sound.

I don't drink at all, so I couldn't even begin to expound on whether or not the drinks are worth the money or not or if their selection is anything to write home about. This is all about the musical side of this particular place.  The Cheyenne Saloon is a fantastic shithole. It's situated in a not-so-great part of town in the furthest corner of a nondescript strip mall on the corner of Cheyenne and Rancho. You would never think that it would be such a great place to see a show, but the bottom line is that it's perhaps one of the most intimate venues in town AND the shows are usually dirt cheap (Anywhere between Free and $25).  Recently, the stage area was given an overhaul and the room looks fantastic compared to how it used to look. The stage is much more wide open and the ceiling has been gutted and re-worked so it's much higher and less claustrophobic. Unfortunately, the air conditioning is actually worse than it was before...so the place usually becomes a sweatbox by the middle of the show.   The pit in front of the stage is about two feet lower than the main floor of the venue and enclosed with a small fence, so it's quite easy to avoid the maelstrom that sometimes erupts in front of the stage simply by staying on the main floor. It's sort of a nice feature, as it becomes frustrating when trying to watch a band, manage a beverage and make sure no one is careening towards you from the mosh pit.  The only real downsides to this joint are the somewhat rowdy clientele and the pervading smell of smoke throughout the entire venue. You DEFINITELY can plan on washing your clothes the night after a show if you want to completely get the smell off of you.  Despite these few downsides, this place is really a paradise for fans of metal music. While they do have the occasional punk show, this place tends to lean towards bringing in national 90s metal bands as well as heavier local acts. It's pretty neat to see bands that use to headline House of Blues and Ozzfest up close because nine times out of ten they come off of the stage and hang out afterwards...great photo opportunities and autograph signings may ensue.  Just so you can get an idea as to some of the acts they've had in this venue, here's some of the bands I've seen come through the Cheyenne Saloon:  Mushroomhead Powerman 5000 Fear Factory Soulfly Paul D'ianno & Blaze Bayley (ex-singers of Iron Maiden)  Not at all a bad place for a heavy music fan to be.
