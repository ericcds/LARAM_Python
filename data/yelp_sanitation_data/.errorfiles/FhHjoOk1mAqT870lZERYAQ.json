The whole  pick me pick me  vibe was absent, thank God.  Of course, it is way off the strip, but the hotel in general truly is a city within itself.  You can hole yourself up here and never leave, but still have a great time.  The music was fab fab fab!!  When we went, it was DJ Digdug and he can really mix.  I don't know if he's the regular dj or not, but hopefully yes because he rocks.  He uses a computer, but vinyl too, which is cool, and becoming increasingly unusual.  The music was all the best dance music you'd want - old and new, and the dance floor was bumping consistently.  I was out there all night.  There is actually a special stage just for the ladies, no guys allowed - interesting, but not always used since you are on display for the world. You better have some confidence to go up there, or a really slutty outfit.  In addition, there are quite a few go go dancers perched about.    The drinks are typically priced ($10 or so for mixed, $7 for beer.)   Generous pours.  Running a tab is difficult because they don't seem to remember the patrons, so you have to keep reminding them who you are.  I say bring cash to make it easier on yourself.  The bathrooms are crazy.  I heard about the mouth-urinals in the guys', but the girls' is another story.  There are no lights in the stalls.  None.  Even the main area where the sinks are is extremely dim lit.  You are practically blind in there, so forget about even trying to fix your lipstick.  Not gonna happen.  When I first entered as a newbie, I opened the stall, saw that it was pitch black, and asked some lady (cougar type - there are many there) where the light is.  She said,  Oh honey, there are no lights in here!  You have to feeeeeeeel your way around.   Oooookay.  I soon realized why.  The stall doors are two way mirrors.  When I went in and closed the door, it was like the door was transparent and I could see everyone outside.  Cool concept I guess, but a little unnerving and I'd rather be able to see.  There are also those annoying attendants trying to sell their perfume squirts and hairspray usage in each bathroom.  I guess it's good when you want something, but I hate when they hand me a paper towel and expect a tip.  The bathroom issues bumped this place down a star.", "Date": "2009-07-07", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Lora", "ReviewID": "KjfWiYWCpFL1UuK6SeeJfw", "Overall": "4", "Content": "So being a Vegas Local I do not frequent the strip nightclub scene often, except when we are entertaining guests from out of town or just in the mood.  When a local has a party sometimes the hassle is to much to bare.  So a friend of mine had her birthday party at Cherry and they did it right!  We had a BLAST!  Keep in mind if you are staying on the strip and not at this casino or live here I do not recommend taking a cab to this casino to party unless you want to do a smaller more local scene, but if you live or are staying here I highly recommend it.  We reserved a table and had ordered a VIP table with bottle service the prices are reasonable compared to strip prices but trust me if you do a club anywhere in vegas be prepared to drop a pretty penny both in VIP and/or just at the bar.  This isn't the local watering hole back home or your local bar down the street, you are paying for so much more then just some drinks.  Don't forget to tip, the tip is not included in any of the prices you are paying for.  The Bar prices were not as stated earlier in posts they are similar in price to strip prices BUT... they were strong!  LOVED that so much.  My boyfriend was not drinking what the bottles on table were so we were getting his at the bar.  The service was fast and the drinks were strong, he was a happy man.  The thing I liked the most about this club was the staff.  Everyone at the door was nice not the same experience I have had at the strip clubs, The bartenders were fast and paid attention when a new person showed up to order a drink.  The waitresses were hot with awesome outfits and very nice on top of that!  The bouncer next to our table kept chatting with us periodically and even busted out a few dance moves through the night.  The female dancers were hot and kept the vibe going but the best part of that was they have male dancers too!  OMG am I in heaven?!  Sadly their faces were covered but they had tight outfits on to show off the muscles, did a lot of cirque moves (quite impressive) and just kinda walked around talking and taking pictures with people.  So all in all as I said earlier we had a ball, I am even thinking of doing a redo for my last bad birthday next year when it comes back around!  I will gladly pay the prices for an all and all great time with pretty great peeps help serve us!", "Date": "2012-08-06", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Rob", "ReviewID": "viDuFZRVJCJOKT9mvfs-8A", "Overall": "4", "Content": "It's really funny how I just watched the movie 21 and they show a scene of them coming into Cherry, and it just looks like a huge club.

I go right to the outside, where the cabanas line a small pool, and there's a much easier to tolerate outside bar.  I've only been here a handful of times, and have never paid or stood in line being a local and all.

Dancers were tight and some of the cocktail servers were looking good, but the VIP table chicks had on Jorts and like knee high socks and sneakers???? WTF?

I don't see it as being a real touristy place. Very cool for the locals. Ok so I know my clubs. When this first opened there were so many problems with it. I had 15 people come in and we ordered 3 bottles which was cool because they were ok with that. We sat in the owners box with the Fertitta's. They were pretty cool. But my bunch was getting rowdy. I had more people coming in and I was getting yelled at by the security guys...right...I'm spending 1600 dollars and you're gonna yell at me for being in the entrance trying to get my people in? Well literally - this place is shaped like a cherry. Stemmed hallway into a round night club. One circular bar - dance floor, vip tables, and an outdoor area. I liked the layout. It was different. The guys bathrooms. FUN. The urinals are shaped like lips. The toilet is one way glass. It's pretty cool.  I've been several times later - sometimes it's hit and miss. My vip host who promised me a free bottle is gone. So new management. Regardless I still got screwed in the end. I don't really endorse this place because of that instance. All the other times I've been here I've felt the same way - I go here for my friends. Not because I want to. I'd rather be at the Rocks Lounge.  Cherry can get to be a little chic with their long lines. Their layout outside sucks because the line can block or be a burden in the casino. But hey it's the Fertitta's they don't care. The other thing is guest lists. There's not really one - if you're important you get walked in. I hate having to call Stations vip to walk me into there. It's retarded. Unless you have a table - that's the only other way you bypass the line. There's a few things in their operations they need to change to make it a little better. Their music format isn't the greatest. Also the bar is a little pricey to compete against a strip casino. Overall. 2.5 stars....Not the biggest place. Not always convenient - it's hit and miss.

I hesitated to give it 4 stars due to the out-of-the-way location, but I went with it anyway.  This is probably not a place for tourists as it's way out in the depths of Summerlin (west Las Vegas), but that's why the Red Rock has become a hit with locals.  You don't have to worry about running into yokels from Maine.  I didn't spend any time in the dance area.  From what I remember it wasn't too big.  They play a lot of the typical hip-hop/r&b/dance music you hear everywhere else.  Outside is where Cherry shines.  Beyond the dance area there's plenty of room to stretch out near several pools.  There's also bars set up with misters so you don't have to fight the dance crowds.  The drinks, like anywhere else are pricey but average by Vegas standards.  A Long Island Ice Tea cost me $7.  A subsequent Corona was a little less.  The gut punch of the night came when I had to pay $6 bucks for bottled water.  Yes, it's some weird Italian stuff I've never seen before, but I shouldn't have to pay full drink price just to try to sober up.  Cherry is one of the newest places in town.  The Red Rock casino itself has gotta be less than two years old.  There is a line to get in.  You must dress well.  Clientele is above average in the looks department.

Loved the fact that the attire is casual, which didn't mean young thugs like other places.  Great diverse crowd and variety of music got the crowd pumped.  We bounced back and forth from Cherry to Rocks Lounge and The Center Bar but kept ending back at Cherry (those damn gogo dancers!! j/k) and altho the crowd thinned out considerably after 3:30am, there was still a fun dance crowd that formed a dance line similar to Soul Train days and then had dance-off going on to old school beats.

Both locals and tourists are there, but it's mostly locals I must say. It didn't bother me but whatever. I still had fun. I was there with a local and some friends of hers from both out of town and in town. A lot of fun was had, and friends made. It really wasn't too crowde at all on the other hand. It was crowded, but not to a point where you can't move. It flowed well and the overall crowd was cool. Didn't feel ghetto or anything like that.  The music was very mixed. I found that awesome. Played some hip hop, to 80's, to some rock. I totally dig that. Clubs out in the Bay Area need to take notes from the clubs in Vegas as what to play.

By  lighter , I mean that the crowd was always a little more lax about partying. The Las Vegas strip clubs (mind you, i did separate strip and club) usually end up in being horrendously filled with ed hardy shirts, true religion jeans, and male hair filled with product fighting the nasty effects of gravity....or wearing suit jackets. Cherry was the perfect mix of locals dressed to the nines while staying casual...make sense?  The entrance way is what kept me coming back: dark, sparkly, and red. The bar was set up at the center of the club where up to 8 bartenders served drinks quick. The drink prices here were the cheapest in the city. Lastly, the poolside always remained open throughout the year with the bungalows used as VIP areas, which always provided a good getaway from the crowded dance floor.
