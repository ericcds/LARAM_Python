After waiting for a good 10 minutes and us having our appetizers already at our table I Had to get the napkins and chopsticks myself from another table!  We have visitors from out of town and this is our go-to place every.single.time!   So today, here we are.   BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!   Had to flag our server for water refill, ordering of beers, more meat and to change to change our grill.   Ordered extra rice and pork belly never came!  We upgraded from Vegas to Spring Mountain- ordered our 1st shrimp and by the time our server came back it was 20 minutes after. Ordered our 2nd batch of shrimp, 10 minutes later had to flag our server down AGAIN and ordered our 3rd batch of shrimp-- She came back and said we are on our 1.30 mark and that would be our last order! UNBELIEVABLE!   We ordered Sapporo, it was given to us no problem. Ordered miller lite and she wanted to ID us, we asked and said you've given us the Sapporo without asking for ID why is it that all of a sudden she wanted to id us for a second batch of beer.  Gratuity is automatically included and I think that is why their service is going down!  This is truly a good clean place to have k BBQ but they should not include gratuity automatically to the bill!   This is where we bring ALL our family and friends from out of town BUT never again until they turn around and offer efficient, courteous service!   So EMBARRASED for bragging about this place to our cousins!   Had to get a copy of our receipt and the name of our Server- Angie. Just an advice- be genuine, efficient and enjoy the company of your customers! Might as well have fun while working and truly fulfill the needs of the hungry customers.   For the caliber and price of food, you can get amazing food and great quality of service from neighboring Kbbq places!

After they seated us they took their time to ask us if we were ready to order with out giving us a menu.   If someone does go here please please read the menu at the bottom  They charge gratuity for parties of 5 and less so what I'm guessing is we have to show up with a fck load of people in order to not have a service charge.  There's also 3 different menus  Nevada 15.95 Locals 19.95 And I think vegas 25.95   The selections were alright for the prices but I mean is rather go somewhere else than to be told you can only have a certain selection with a certain amount of money.

WISH IT WAS A 5 STAR REVIEW BUT...  I have never been to a more disgusting place ever. I do not want to go into the sanitary and cleanliness of this restaurant due to Yelp rules but I will say that  Dirty Dining  should definitely investigate.   Honestly not a big fan of Korean BBQ but family wanted to eat here. It's a All You Can Eat BBQ. You pick 1 out of the 3 menus they have which is of course 3 different prices. We went with the Vegas menu which was about $20 per person. You get to choose the meats that is on that menu. We went with Bulgogi, spicy pork, spicy chicken, and the family had cow intestines. Yes, INTESTINES! you already know I did not touch that at all. We also got an order of shrimp for the kids that is not included in the Vegas menu so it was an extra $25. They bring out little small plates, kind of like appetizers in the beginning. There was fish cakes, spicy broccoli, kim chi, jalapeños, mashed potatoes, horse radish, house salad, and soup. When the meats come out, There is a stove on the table and you actually cook it yourself.   we had a few different waitresses assigned to our table because we were a party of 14. One of them pulled the table without acknowledging my phone was on there and dropped it. Good thing it didn't break or else I would have went crazy on her. Our drinks came after we got the food which was pretty unacceptable. I was thirsty! So we were eating spicy food without any waters for a good 10 minutes.

The restaurant is located on the second floor of a strip mall in Chinatown, and the decor is very plain (typical Asian restaurant). The service is just alright - we were seated and served very quickly, but subsequent visits from the waitress were few and far between (annoying when you're trying to take advantage of an AYCE).  The side dishes were pretty good, and I was happy with the larger than usual quantities. The AYCE I ordered included pork belly, beef brisket, spicy chicken, and spicy pork. I usually judge the restaurant by their spicy pork, as it's my favorite, and this one was a little bit hit and miss - the first order we got was really good, but the second one seemed flavorless in comparison.

Our favorite is the Angus Beef Fingers, not sure why they call it that since it's not in strip like chicken fingers but more like slices of meats. It's marinated in the bulgogi style.   If you're looking for price point choices this is the place to go. When they do get busy the service can be  a bit slow.

I don't even know where to start, really. This is my SECOND time giving this place a try and this place is truly a joke. The first time I went, we requested 2 grills for the 6 of us, because usually Sura BBQ never had a problem with it. They rudely refused our request, so we walked out, but no hard feelings.  The second time, though, was different. We had a party of 6, again, but this time was different because my grandma cannot eat pork due to religious restrictions. We went in and kindly asked for separated grills, because some of us wanted to eat some pork belly. We told the waitress that our grandma could not eat pork due to her religion and the waitress, with a straight face, told us that  oh sorry, why don't you just cook beef first, then pork? We cant give you 2 tables.  I was shocked, I really was. This is my first time ever being rejected of a separate grill because of religious restrictions. So I asked for the manager and was told that there  was no manager . I was getting angry and told them that they are basically refusing service because of her religion and they carelessly blurted out words like  sorry we can't  and  no manager .   Seeing how many bad reviews that they have for their service, I'd hire a complete new set of waitresses if I was a manager.

It's located in the same shopping center as Ichiza and Tea Station. We came in and were seated right away. The dining area is pretty big and we really enjoyed the ambiance.   There were three different AYCE options: Nevada, Vegas, and Spring Mountain. We went with Nevada. First, we ordered brisket, pork belly, and steamed egg. It came with the house salad and your typical KBBQ starters (kimchi, broccoli, tofu, etc.). I thought the salad was okay. The waitress quickly brought out the brisket and pork belly. The brisket was delicious, which was enough to seal the deal for us. Pork belly and steamed egg were good, but not amazing. We also ordered the marinated chicken halfway through. The chicken wasn't my favorite, there wasn't much flavor to it.   To sum it up, the AYCE kbbq was a good experience.

Their AYCE menu is split up into three categories. Nevada (~$15.99) has the basics of KBBQ: beef brisket, pork belly, marinated chicken, and a few other meats. Vegas (~$19.99) and the last option (~$23.99) offer more protein goodness like beef tongue, spicy marinated meats, and large intestine. You can't go wrong with any of them, really. It's meat.   Kimchi, sliced fish cakes, bean sprouts, broccoli, marinated jalapeños, and potato salad make up their banchan. Pretty standard quality and flavor. Wish that I got to try their steamed egg though. They don't have rice paper, so you can either chow down on salad or order rice.  Service was inconsistent considering that my coworkers and I were some of the few diners that evening. They would bring the meats and banchan out quickly, but didn't respond to our repeated requests for water. I know we're in the desert and all, but should we really have to ask several times? Even when the water pitcher was finally brought over, the eight of us drained it before the ice had a chance to melt.

Korea) birthday as she was craving Korean BBQ.  We normally--in the past--have gone to Sura but decided to change it up for this occasion.  Well, we now know that we will NOT be going back EVER to this place!  I will say that the place had decent food...brisket was good and so was the pork bulgogi.  But, the banchan was just mediocre...and based on the review pics from the past it seems liked we didn't get the full selection of side dishes.    We got there around 6:00 PM and and we started to cook the AYCE  Nevada  BBQ (priced at $16.95/person) around 6:14 PM.  I only know this because I started to snap some pics of the group around that time on my iPhone.  Why did I check this a little later on, you ask?  Well, our server rudely wanted to turn off our grill around 7:15 PM and we told her we still wanted to eat a little more.  She then told us that the time limit was 1.5 hrs for the AYCE and we had only 10 more minutes.  Say what?  I was quite shocked as I have never been to a KBBQ that actually had a TIME LIMIT!!!  So, I checked my phone and saw that I snapped the first picture at 6:14 PM.  Which means we didn't have only 10 minutes left, but actually 30 minutes left when we were rudely advised.  Ironically, we were all getting stuffed anyway, and was ready to wrap up soon.  Now keep in mind, that some other tables who came in before us were STILL eating when we were told we had to wrap it up.  I guess they must have had  cooler  waitresses than ours.  I asked to speak to the manager and she smiled and listened, but you could tell she could have cared less ( Oh yes, uh huh, ok, sorry.... ).  She even told me--as I spoke in a normal voice complaining about how we were cheated out of a half hour in our  timed  1 1/2 hr allotment (geez, that kills me to even have to mention that!)--that I needed to  calm down .  After, just standing there for several minutes with no offer to make us feel better or even a nice gesture in words, I said  Thanks anyway...I guess you can go then ...and she did!  So, be forewarned that depending on who your server is...and I guess if you don't fit the mold of true Koreans/Asians (I'm Korean-American, BTW)...you may be told to wrap it up and stop eating as your time may be up!  So, combined with lousy, slow service, you could be getting very little BBQ for what is supposed to be AYCE.  My advice to you is to go to Sura or another local AYCE Korean BBQ.  At least there you won't get horrible service and a ridiculous time allotment for eating.  If you don't heed my warning, then maybe you better bring a stopwatch to verify that you really are getting 1.5 hrs to eat their so-called  AYCE .", "Date": "2015-07-04", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Arkay", "ReviewID": "LBJ690sfLuk91iUDFvJbpA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "This is one of my favorite kbarb place to go aside from Tofu Hut.

This place has been around for years. It was one of the very first K-BBQ joints that my fam and I discovered here in Vegas.  From what I was told by one of the servers, they remodeled the entire restaurant about 3 months ago from today (1/2/2017). The interior became more modern and they've added some new decor. A nice upgrade from before.  Service has never been a problem here and the staff are always attentive. They will keep coming back to your table to ask if you need anything else or to see if the grill needs to be changed. However, this restaurant does get busy and they may miss your table at times when helping other customers, but no biggie.  Compared to other K-BBQ restaurants in Vegas, I prefer their All You Can Eat (AYCE). I base it off the quality, cleanliness, and selection. There are 2 different AYCE prices to choose from. You can either choose the  Spring Mountain  menu or the  Vegas  menu. There used to be a menu selection called the Nevada, but their menus have changed since they've remodeled.  The Spring Mountain one has a lil bit more items to choose from for just $4 more per person. It would be the better choice. ;] Especially if you like more meat options, seafood, and other miscellaneous food items.  If you're craving for some Korean BBQ, but aren't sure which one to eat at, give this place a try!

If you have, you are well aware that their service isn't all about smiles and chatting, but one of diligence and speed.  Some reviewers before me complained about the service being awful, but I assume they aren't used to the way things are run in places like this.  It may not be an excuse, but as long as I get my drink refills and food on time and they pass by and glance at our table to ensure that we are constantly well kept, I don't care if Chung Li smiles at me or not.  If they do their job well, I'm happy.  With that off my shoulders, let's get to the juicy review!  This is the sister restaurant of Maru in Summerlin, and I have to say that I prefer this place over Maru any day of the year.  We discovered this place on a whim after trying the restaurant below this one (it was horrid). We walked in and there's a faux well in the dining area and everything is clean and well kept.  That's always a good sign.  They seat you or you tell them where you want to be seated, you get the menu and begin the experience.  They have a variety of traditional Korean dishes, and with the Korean patrons eating there when we first arrived I knew this would be good.  We ordered our typical dishes--bulgogi and kalbi, shrimp tempura appetizer to start.  We asked that they cook it in the back, and they did.  Our tempura was out on our table within five minutes along with the usual side dishes.  I personally love the picked radish and croquette.  Their rokio is good, too, although not the typical white pearl onion version.  Our food arrived promptly, and we waited no more than ten minutes (if that) for the food.  It was good.  I mean really, really good.  When the waitress brought out the salad and then--wait for it.....the radish beef soup,. i wanted to cry.  Let me explain my need for this soup.  When I was five years old my parents took me to a Korean BBQ restaurant back home.  They served this awesome clear broth soup with what I assumed was thinly sliced potatoes and maybe a touch or two of beef.  As simple as it sounds, it's a traditional soup appetizer to have with a Korean meal, and I've eaten it every time I had BBQ out at a restaurant.  For two and a half years we searched Korean BBQ places in Las Vegas for this appetizer, and for some reason none of them serve it.  Finally, after 2.5 years of searching, when the girl brought the soup out in its traditional low-rimmed bowl and I had to use the typical long-stemmed spoon to eat it, i teared up.  My childhood wafting in my face with the smells of radish and beef broth.  It was a great moment.  The soup is simple and contains nothing but clear brother flavored by the radish and beef, with thin slices of radish and one or two pieces of shredded beef in the bowl.  It's simply yummy.  After eating two bowls of it along with the great BBQ and appetizer, I was stuffed and thoroughly happy. I craved the BBQ daily for a week and satisfied my craving for dinner that week.  I never get sick of bulgogi and kalbi.    When I finally cooked it at our table one night I decided that was the way to go from now on because I could burn my bulgogi a bit more than the cooks in the back would to get that sweeter flavor.  If you ever go to a Korean bbq place, cook it yourself.  It's fun and tasty!  Overall, a great experience, and my only BBQ place where they serve my childhood soup.  I'm looking forward to more of their food again next week, and the week after, and the week after that.

She heard from a friend that the place served a pretty good lunch special... she begged to differ. I know she sets the bar pretty high when it comes to Korean comfort food, she's been cooking it all her life for her family and her restaurant. So with that in mind... she was not a happy camper. There was a lot more misses than hits and I agreed... it was just subpar.   Service: was subpar. We repeatedly asked our waters to be filled. I would understand if they were busy, but the restaurant was barely half-filled. When we asked for a little more banchan, Mr. Server only came back with a small plate of kimchii. =/   Food: was just okay. We ordered several lunch specials. Portions were smaller than what we had anticipated although the presentation was pretty. (See pix)  Prices: pricey. Korean food is not cheap by any means. Since prepping includes washing and rinsing and chopping and mixing and rinsing summo and squeezing... I know the drill. I've served as a prep-er under  my kimchii-mama-in-law's direction. So the amount of work that goes in every dish is crucial to making an delectable meal. The quality at Korean Garden BBQ house is lacking luster, lacking flavor, and lacking overall yumminess. I didn't see how much lunch racked up to be, but I suppose it didn't add up to the kind of lunch she didn't think was worth paying for what she did. She was saying a whole bunch of Korean words about the place I didn't understand that didn't seem forthcoming at all.

The waitresses, more than one, would come to put plates of food on our table and not even fill up or care about my water!

Honestly speaking you don't need any other meat except the brisket (cha dol baek ee). This is because the others are pretty thick and heavy or heavily marinated. They also just don't taste good. The brisket is thin, light, and full of flavor. If you need more flavor then use the sauces that they give you.   There are ladies who come around to help you cook and what not, but you honestly never need any of their help because come on.... if you're a man, you know how to grill, if you're a woman, you know how to cook.

Initially I meant to go to Tofu Hut, however I was not going to wait an hour for it. Hunting on Yelp, I discovered Korean Garden BBQ House. What interested me were their pricings:   They have 3 different pricings: Nevada $14-15.99, Las Vegas $19.99, and Spring Mtn $22-23.99. Nevada having the shortest list of items to Spring Mtn having the longest list of items - depending on which pricing you choose, you may choose as many items on that list to your liking.  I chose the Las Vegas pricing (Nevada pricing does not offer Japchae or Bulgogi.) I ordered Japchae, Marinated Chicken, Bulgogi, and Pork Belly. Second Round something Rib Fingers, Bulgogi, Beef Brisket, and something item that slipped my mind. The portions of meat were huge considering two types of meat were on one plate.   The service was meh (staff forgot a couple of items we asked for) which doesn't help when the menu states - parties of 5 OR LESS 15% gratuity is already included -_- poop. I guess you can't complain(maybe you can) because the staff does cook and cut the meat for you.   Like what other YELPers say - staff in the beginning are attentive and helpful, however later on... they just aren't haha. The bill took a while to arrive that I ended up walking up to the counter and paying - bout $50 for my meal.   You may not make this mistake (I did) so just a note, do the math for the pricing you choose - add tax(8.1%) and 15% gratuity to make sure you actually want to pay $xx.xx for this meal (since now you can't choose how much gratuity to give but can choose what pricing you'd like)  I could have lived without the Japchae and if I could, would have left just 10% to 13% gratuity.", "Date": "2014-06-16", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Stella", "ReviewID": "9TlIu-I-Nv6QyupXO4OJBA", "Overall": "2", "Content": "I dined here with a friend yesterday and the first thing that drew us in was the happy hour special. We were able to choose 2 different types of Korean BBQ, a soup, and a beer or soju for just about $26. This is a great deal when it comes to Korean BBQ. The portions were ideal for 2 people. Most of the waitresses were friendly and helpful; however, we had one girl as our main waitress and she was not attentive and awfully rude. She left the bulgogi (Korean marinated beef) on the stove too long and it almost burned, so I had to flip them over, cut the meat, and distribute myself. Anytime we asked her for something, she seemed angry and frustrated. We said  thank you  for everything she brought over (with extreme delay I might add), and I never heard her once say  you're welcome . She spoke fluent English, so I knew that wasn't the issue. Also, the food... I guess coming from the NYC area I am extremely biased; however, I was rather disappointed. The food wasn't bad, but it was nowhere near my expectations. The bulgogi was in large pieces and not juicy and the pork bulgogi was not spicy (pork bulgogi is supposed to be a spicy, flavorful dish). The side dishes were the most disappointing part. Usually, in Korean BBQ houses, you receive a bunch of side dishes to compliment your meal. Korean Garden BBQ House only gives about 4.
