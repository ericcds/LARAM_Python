So great to have a good boba place in the North West area instead of having to drive to China Town.   The owners are very friendly & can suggest popular and tasty drinks if you haven't been here before. I usually get the strawberry pudding w/ boba or the strawberry mango smoothie with boba & mango jelly stars. Both super yummy!   They have a wide variety of tea flavors, smoothie, flavors, topping and even food. Food is pretty good. Popcorn chicken is good and so is the ramen. Perfect for a rainy or cold day.  I've also had the fish balls but I'd suggest eating them there cause they didn't taste as good when I brought them home.   All in all this place is a cute place to sit and have a drink or snack.

I returned it, and after 5 more mins of waiting,  one of the employees did apologize, however they could not offer to remake another batch of yakisoba fries because they ran out of ingredients. They ended up refunding me with another apology.  The takoyaki was soggy and drowning in bulldog sauce, making the entire thing tok salty to eat.

I had the Taro Smoothie with Boba and it was delicious! It tasted like Lucky Charms marshmallow's! The only thing I would have changed was the size, it was just too large for me to finish.

Can I call this place a mom and pop shop?  Or should I just call this a Vegas gem instead?  Whatever, it's good.  They'll make it to your satisfaction also.  They'll pour out a little bit into a cup and have you sample your selection to see if it's just right, too sweet, not flavorful, or simply not right and will make it for you again.  So far in my experience they've hit the ball out of the ballpark each time.  They also have stamp cards so you can build up stamps and earn a free drink after so many stamps.

The only reason it doesn't get five stars is because five stars indicates perfection to me, and it's not quite perfect.  Pros 1) They have just about any kind of tea, slushie, or smoothie you can imagine and you can add boba to it. $3.50 for a regular, and $4.50 for a large (with boba) 2) They have ramen. Enough said. 3) They have donburi. I did not try it this time, but I plan to next time. 4) The ramen portion was huge. I had to have them bag it up for me. They even separated the noodles and the broth so the noodles wouldn't get too soggy. They clearly have my undying love just for this. 5) The pork in the tonkotsu ramen was fantastic. 6) Free wifi. 7) Workers were so friendly and helpful. They didn't make me feel like I was inconveniencing them because I chose to stay there for three hours to get some work done. 8) Prices were great. I got ramen (which I didn't finish) and a large Thai milk tea with boba for under $12.   Cons 1) The tonkotsu ramen broth was nothing to write home about.  2) Loud people came in groups that could be annoying if one wanted to use the place to study. Same with the smoothie machine. 3) Lighting could be better.  In short, they have all the things I love in Japanese express food with reasonable prices, an atmosphere more or less suitable for camping out with a laptop and and an endless pile of books, and free wifi.

It's quiet, the tables are large, and the food and drinks are beyond FABULOUS!  I usually either get the milk tea ($3.25) or the lychee smoothie ($3.95). Both are equally addicting!  The food is good too.  Try the onigiri rice balls and the shaker fries - YUM!  Also the pricing here is reasonable (Tea Station charges $4 something for their tea!) and the service is fast and friendly!      So, all in all, this place ROCKS!

I used to give my tokens to my uncle because he was pretty good at it. Today, I grabbed this cute little kuma with the claw at Tea Time after one try! My daughter watched and she thinks I'm a winner, plus she got a cute strawberry bear toy that looks like the bowl she threw on the floor at Sweets Raku. My husband is good at winning this game, so he could probably clean out the machine with $20.  The guys at Tea Time Cafe make so many great drinks. There has to be at least 50 options on the menu. They have every flavor except black sesame. Almond milk tea is my standard order, but Thai tea, chai, honeydew, and peach-passion fruit slush are other favorites. Today, I cashed in my stamp card complete with ten punches for a free large pina colada yogurt smoothie with boba and egg pudding. I was pretty much on a winning streak. I almost drove to Primm and bought lottery tickets. The egg pudding was really good, too. The mixed jello drinks look interesting so I will have to order one.  Service is very friendly! If I'm in a hurry or in need of a pick me up on my way to work, I will call in my drink order and it is always ready when I arrive. The claw machine was dark when I was trying to feed it a dollar, so the nice guy turned it on for us. I also bought the tiniest Domo figurine out of a four quarters machine.  Prices are fair, with all drinks costing under $5. The sweet butter brick toast is caramelized like creme brulee and so good! There's a lot more on the menu, but that's all I've tried. I see a lot of people ordering Spam musubi. If your usual boba spot doesn't have arcade games and Domo toys, you should come here instead. If your usual boba spot doesn't have a stamp card, you're wasting money.

It's a cute little place that doesn't get too crowded if you go at the right time of the day and they have a bunch of board games, card games, and books to keep you occupied while you stay and enjoy your food and/or drinks. Whenever I come here with people we always end up staying for hours because we get caught up playing different card games or Jenga or something lol.  Their drinks are so good! They have so many unique flavors and they can do your drink in a variety of ways; slush, blended, got, iced, milk tea, etc. They also have food and snacks you can order. I've tried their tempura curry udon, which wasn't bad at all. But my favorite things to get are their Yakisoba Fries and Takoyaki. Where the hell else can you get good Takoyaki in North Las Vegas?! I applaud Tea Time Cafè for having items such as Takoyaki, cuttlefish balls, honey toast, and ramen on their menu because there really aren't a lot of places, if any, in Northtown where you can get stuff like that.

The food menu is simple but very satisfying. The ramen is fresh and delicious and the snacks like spam musubi are tasty. Owned and operated by a family, one of my favorite local businesses.

Ordered Thai tea with boba 25% sugar, taro milk tea, 3 jasmine green teas with aloe with varying levels of sweetness. My family has varying tastes of sweetness and it was great that Tea Time can make drinks from 0% sweetness (sugar, honey or splenda) following in increments of 25%.   Onto the food... Really REALLY sad that they no longer carry popcorn chicken or curry fries. To me, popcorn chicken is a staple at boba places so was sad when I was told they no longer carry it. Oh well. I did order takoyaki and garlic seaweed parmesan fries. Both were delicious!

Henderson still doesn't have good boba, but Centennial does? I'm happy for you guys, I guess...  Highly rated boba always intrigues me, but I wasn't able to justify the super long drive from home until I was already in the area to visit a friend. On my way home, Tea Time Cafe was a convenient stop just off the highway, so I was eager to visit.  I stuck to one of my go-to orders, a large jasmine milk tea ($4.25, 24 oz) with boba (usually +$0.35, but Yelp check-in = one free topping). It didn't take too long for them to prepare the drink, and I was happy to see a bubbly froth on the surface indicating that they'd shaken it to create the namesake bubbles of the bubble tea.  The jasmine flavor wasn't extremely strong, but it was noticeable in every sip. The boba tasted fine considering that it's not honey boba. I overheard that it was freshly made, and it was actually was a little too al dente at the time. But it's always better to err on the side of chewy tapioca pearls than mushy.  I didn't make any adjustments, but on a warm day like today, it was better to err on the side of ice. As for sweetness, it was pretty balanced considering that I took on the default full sugar level instead of going for 75% or 50%  Instead of a stamp card, they use FiveStars. It's a unified system that I often see in California, and you can check in for a reward via phone number, keychain card, wallet-sized card, or even app. Ten drinks = one free large drink, and I'd be very content with that if I lived or worked anywhere remotely nearby.  As it is, I just don't see myself coming back very often, but I will keep Tea TIme Cafe in my memory banks just in case I'm in the area.

And, I really wanna write a nice review for Tea Time Cafe that will still be around this time next year. So, I've decided to drop my tired and worn out  Schtick  in order to avoid violating any more TOS. Therefore, I have devised an ingenious idea to use everyone else's schticks, since they don't seem to have as many reviews deleted.   So here it goes:   THE SKINNY Tea Time Cafe is a real jewel of the Northwest. THE SKINNY, they have honey toast with green tea ice cream. THE SKINNY I loved it more than I love Canada.  THE SKINNY, with honey toast in the NW, I don't have to drive to Ichiza or Shuseki anymore! THE SKINNY, the guy who manages this place was really nice to me and didn't mind that I waited on the couch for 10 minutes for my friends to show up. THE SKINNY, they got a cool claw machine that has rilakkuma and domos.  THE SKINNY I don't LIKE Tea Time Cafe. I LOVE it. THE SKINNY If I don't love it, I don't swallow.   I LOVE BIG WEINERS! But they didn't have weiners here, MORONS! So perhaps my morals helped me get the curry fries. They are perhaps like chili cheese fries but with curry instead of chili. The fries weren't immoral and perhaps were cooked extra crispy. It did not hella suck. Perhaps, it was the opposite of sucking. Speaking about sucking, I sucked them down like a hoover! The workers were not IDIOTS or CREEPY immorals! They were actually really nice, SCORE! Perhaps, I love the fries more than I love big weiners. And the prices be so low dat I be ballin on a budget! YAY!  GABAZINGA! I'm so fun! I showed up to Tea Time Cafe alone, but I always have fun when I'm around! While waiting for my friend to show up, I broke out my photography skills and took several pictures of the food I ordered. But, I accidentally deleted all the photos before uploading them onto yelp. Jeez could I be more ridiculous? I sometimes wish I could be! Wizzle Wozzle! The curry fries were perfectly browned and the curry itself was made from a real gram masala rather than a powder mix. It wasn't JCZ, but I was satisfied and not too uncomfortably full. I wasn't trippin... and after taking a selfie with that same goofball face I always make, Amanda and I ended up break dancing on out of there.

More or less. I've gotten about 6 or 7 free drinks with the stamp card over the past few years... So that's about 60-70 drinks purchased? Dang. That's a lot of money- I guess I should cut down. Lol yeah right.  Tea Time has always been super adorable- a great place to hang with friends, study, go on a date, or people watch. Actually it's a small place and people will notice you being creepy- so don't do that. They have couches, games, a crane machine, a bookshelf, a community bulletin board (love!), bright decor, friendly staff, always clean surfaces, and better boba than I've found in Chinatown so far. Of course that could be due to no longer looking for anything better, as this place is close to me and my favorite place ever.  If you're new to trying boba, get the honeydew, taro, or Thai milk tea with boba. They have a bunch of other awesome flavors to try the second or tenth time you come here, but you haven't tried boba tea until you've tried those three flavors. I recommend ALL the drinks on the menu. I only had one drink I didn't like a long time ago, and it turned out the guy who made it was new and turned off quite a few customers with his creations. He's either gone or not making drinks anymore though, so not to worry!   Food? Better stick with the veggie spring rolls. I know quite a few people who like the food there, but I'm not one of them. The spring rolls are pretty yummy though.  Recently they started selling little macarons... And for $1.65 each you wouldn't think I would buy one. But I did. And then I bought three more. And I would have paid $2 each. SO good. Don't shove the whole dang thing in your mouth, just take little bites and let it melt in your mouth, and you've got more than your money's worth.

Tea Time is run by Ken and Ritchie, two super friendly brothers who always have welcoming smiles. Surprisingly, they provide an extravagant array of selections from milk teas to slushes to smoothies. Their boba is well-cooked and chewy, and they actually offer egg pudding and aloe vera as inclusions!! They will soon have sago, something that I've been waiting for forever in Vegas! They make a FANTASTIC taro smoothie, which I find myself now addicted to. Their lychee is yummy and not overly-sweet, and Ken even went out of his way to make me a thai iced tea smoothie, which turned out deliciously.   If drinks aren't your thing, Tea Time also offers a great snacking menu from mochi ice cream to dim sum dumplings to their new shaker fries (the curry flavor is my fav).   The decor is open and refreshingly clean, a welcome environment in this desert heat. What I appreciate most is the fact that it doesn't smell like  fried,  unlike some other boba tea houses in Vegas that don't have adequate ventilation for their frying stations.

I looked through the reviews and the pictures and decided to give this place a try.  This is definitely a minimalist style food serving establishment.  There is very little decoration on the walls, which are painted a bold green.  The seating and tables are your patio variety done in white and green.  All in all, I thought there was way  too much green and I felt overloaded with the greenness of the deco.  The  specials  board which is done in multiple rainbow florescent colors that is back lit does catch your eyes, but was smudged and hard to read due to the missing letters.  I couldn't make out half of what the specials were.  The main reason I wanted to try this place wasn't for the boba style, frozen / milk tea drinks, but for the snacks that they have (or had) on the menu.  There are several pictures and reviews on this Yelp page that show their Popcorn Chicken, Beef Bowls and Ramin Noodle Soups.  I was disappointed to find that these are no longer being sold here.  She didn't explain why they were removed from the menu, but I was left with two of the other items that were left on my list of items to try.  I tried the Yakisoba fries and the Takoyaki.    Both the Yakisoba fries and the Takoyaki are similar in their toppings.  Both are topped with drizzled seasoned mayo, sesame seeds, seaweed flakes and what tasted like a salty soy based sauce which together tasted very good.  The Takoyaki are deep fried balls filled with a creamy filling that also contains what appeared to be squid.  I enjoyed both of them, but for the price of $4.95 each, I would go with the fries especially if you were to share them with someone.  There is more to go around.  The Takoyaki also comes out very hot and takes a long time for it to cool down in the center unless you open it up and let it cool before deciding to place one in your mouth and devour it.  The food was okay, but the service was a bit chaotic.  i did have to wait quite a long time for other customer drink orders to be made before my food order was started.  There were several drink orders that were placed after mine and served before mine.  What can I say?  They are drink orders, but I believe that time management wasn't successfully accomplished here when dealing with the only food order amongst a lot of drink orders.  Next time I'll come in for the drinks as they did look very well made and delicious for the price.    If you are going to order a  snack  as they call it on their menu, I would recommend ordering a drink with it as well.  You will get your drink and be able to enjoy it while you wait for your snack.  The snacks take quite a bit longer to prepare than the drinks.  All in all, I felt the price of the  snacks  were about a dollar too high for what you get.  The two that I tried were good though.  The decor of the cafe is an explosion of green with accents of black and white.  I felt like I was in a mint chocolate chip bowl of ice cream.   There was a black couch and chair off to one side of the dining area that had a coffee table that looked nice.    I did like that this place does have games, WiFi, a small bookshelf and some coin operated games.  It's a good place for kids, teens, and younger tweens.  If you have children I'm sure they would enjoy it here.  Especially if they like feeling like they are in a giant bowl of mint chocolate chip ice cream.  The service was what i would call  typical .  The cashier took my order, explained that they no longer made the items i came in for then waited while I looked at the menu in order to recognize something else I wanted.  She offered no help or assistance.   She didn't offer any suggestions.    After waiting what I felt was a long time for the  snacks  that I ordered, the person who brought out the food to the tables bypassed me completely, went over to another table and asked if the food was theirs.  I had to politely announce myself to let him know that he had the food I ordered.  He did apologize for walking passed me, set the food down and quickly went back to work behind the counter.  I do have to take into account that the place was busy with drink orders.  A lot of people were ordering what looked like the blended Taro milk tea with boba.  It was purple and did look well made, but I'll have to try their drinks another time.  When I do I will update this review, until then I hope you find this review helpful.", "Date": "2014-09-22", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Kevin", "ReviewID": "fa7Fqi2meqoZkbnBe5tbcA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Best damn Tea/Smoothie shop period.

Every time we would go to the Cracked Egg I would look to see if it was open yet. My anticipation was matched when I tried their milk tea for the first time. It didn't last more than a minute.  I have actually visited the cafe about 3 times before today. My boyfriend always lets me try whatever concoction he has and each time they have been yummy. The mango green tea with mango jelly stars was intensely flavorful and the mango coconut smoothie is good also. My standby is usually boba milk tea, however that may change here soon.   Tonight we introduced my mom to the cafe and needless to say she will be a repeat customer. She ordered the taro milk tea. I think it will be my new favorite. It was not overly sweet and I could almost say it had faint chocolate notes. I am not a big fan of sweet potatoes and most products derived from them, but this is a keeper.  I haven't tried any of the dishes on the menu but they tempt my palate as far as munch food goes. I am a big izakaya fan so gyoza and deep fried anything are right up my alley.

We didn't try the famous coconut smoothie, but the green milk tea and honey milk tea were perfectly sweet with great herbal aroma of the green tea. 2.  Seasoned fries  yakisoba  style - Basically crispy fries topped with seaweed and Japanese mayo.  It is what they call  animal style.   Great on first few bites, but the mayo can get a little overwhelming. 3.  Curry Chicken Cutlet Bento box - This was not too impressive.  The breading on the chicken was on the softer side rather than being nice and crispy. 4.  Yakisoba!  Wow on the portion size and wow on the fancy drizzling of seaweed and mayo.  This was very yummy.  Noodles were nice and springy, but again, mayo can get a little overwhelming.  Conclusion:  Great tea place option on this side of town; solid 5 stars for fantastic green tea.

I have become a fan of Tea Time Cafe for their menu variety and price range, cafe environment, and short drive from my home.  For teas, they serve iced and iced milk. Non-tea drinks include caffeine-free pudding drinks, milk, yogurt drinks, jello drinks, and smoothies. They use real tea leaves in their tea. The owner said that their menu is still developing because (1) they just opened and (2) they do not have the tea leaves yet for some of the drinks they want to make. Thank goodness for the absence of powder mixes in my tea. I, for one, ordered iced honey green tea with boba, and it was authentic and very well-made. They also make their boba every 3 or 4 hours, so they're always fresh, chewy, and they don't get stuck in your straw. You know how you can taste the love in your drinks? Yeah. It was that kind of moment. And did I mention you have a choice of toppings for an extra 25 cents? That was new to me.  In addition to drinks, Tea Time Cafe offers Asian-fusion snacks, like sweet butter toast and calamari, and meals, such as large-portioned bentos and noodles--all of which are wallet-friendly. The full meals are the most expensive on the menu, but are priced at less than $8.00 each. I ordered the curry pork cutlet bento, and was surprised to find it came with sides: soup, two gyozas, orange slices, and assorted vegetables. I was full, and my wallet was only slightly less. Tea Time Cafe is also earth friendly, as their bentos are served in reusable and recyclable bento boxes (I kept and cleaned mine to use for lunch at work). There is also a very convenient picture menu at the register for those who are unfamiliar with Asian-fusion meals.  The cafe setting itself is very clean and relaxing. Music videos are played on a mounted flat screen at an appropriate volume, and the air inside is cool and refreshing. The earlier comment made by David N. about the ventilation being well-kept is spot on. Wi-Fi is also available and free, and I saw open outlets next to some tables for those more ancient laptops, like mine, or if your iPhone needs a quick charge. The cafe is located in a quiet area, so this place would be perfect for studying and writing papers.  Tea Time Cafe is a rare commodity in northwest Las Vegas. With prices going up everywhere else, I have to be picky about the amount of money I spend on gas and food, all while I please my fickle palette.

The staff, service, cute spot, aaaaaand BOBA drinks -- they're all around.    Rich & Ken are the nicest people and welcomed me my first time in.  They also give you the low down on how they run things - wanna try a new drink? Don't be scared to waste your money! They'll give you a sample and if you don't like it, they'll make a new one for no additional charge.  You can also have them adjust the sweetness to your liking.  How awesome is that!  I actually saw a customer come in and want her drink remade and they were more than happy ---- unlike Starbucks who has a similar promise but the 2 times I've actually taken them up on it, I get a nasty look and the drink practically thrown back at me looking even more beat than before.    I'm a regular with the boba milk tea, royal milk tea (more flower taste), honey green tea, and rose tea.  ALL amazing.  Their flavors for everything are not overwhelming so you can finish an entire drink without feeling yucky.  Also, their boba servings are generous which is nice after paying $4-5 on a drink (Like some places only giving you literally 10pcs of boba??? You shouldn't be able to count it!!).

BUUUUT here are the reasons why you should get there and return again and again:  1. super friendly service! very nice young gentlemen were running the front when I stopped by. Both very helpful and made small talk with me while I was waiting for my order. 2. made-to-order food/drink (sort of). If you want a smoothie, you can actually mix flavors together! I got a Taro and Red Bean smoothie (these are usually separately flavored drinks) to satisfy my love of both delights. The best part is, if you don't like your drink (you want it sweeter, less sweet, didn't like the flavor at all, etc.) they will fix it for you or replace it with something else! 3. Tastes great!

The good: my brother and I called fifteen minutes before we came in. When we got inside, our food was ready for pick up.  The off (not necessarily bad, but a bit disappointing, maybe the person was new? Who knows?): when we called, it was pretty clear what we ordered. The person taking our order even repeated our order when she gave us the total. Two thai milk tea smoothies, one with extra boba and one without. We got two peach smoothies both had boba in it. Took back the order because it wasn't right and reiterated my order, by that point, a lot more customers started coming in. Got the right drink, and both had boba in it. My brother has some weird allergy reaction to tapioca that was pretty mild at first, but over time has gotten pretty bad, so he tries to avoid it. By this point, there were too many customers, we had somewhere to be and couldn't wait for another order. Just disappointed that I paid for two drinks, only to be able to drink one.

Located just off the highway in a hidden shopping center, Tea Time Café has a surprisingly large menu of beverages, simple sushi rolls, and snacks. Service is polite, space is decorated like a teenagers bedroom (not necessarily in a bad way), and the snacks are pretty decent.  ICED PEPPERMINT GREEN TEA w/BOBA: I could drink this stuff daily. I will likely come back specifically for this beverage and try to order it as my regular drink at other boba places. The mint is artificial tasting but it's very refreshing, boba was decent. RICE BALLS: Your choice of salmon or tuna, in a rice ball, lightly fried exterior drizzled with furikake and eel sauce. I paid the upcharge for salmon and what I received smelled like tuna and was fairly tasteless. Maybe this just isn't for me. SUSHI ROLLS: The rolls available here all seem to be simple variations of the California roll. The roll I selected had  crispy onion and tuna  but  was crab and avocado, topped with those fried bits that really aren't onions at all, along with a ton of spicy mayo. Tasted decent, portion was good for the $7 price.   If I was in the area more often, I'd probably hit this place up regularly but it's not worth going out of the way for.

For us folks out in the North/Northwest to have a spot to grab a boba or no boba (because boba isn't a name of a drink...just mochi like balls that are added as an option into your beverage) is GOLD I tell you! They serve your usual  boba  beverages such as milk tea, iced/hot teas, smoothies, slushy, lattes, and more!  I used to frequent a boba shop back home in Hawaii and always ordered a Strawberry Iced Black Tea. Upon moving here (2004) I always longed for my drink and searched the valley but to no avail. I noticed Tea Time not long after they opened when it was just the two brothers working the whole thing themselves and was excited to see they offered flavors to be mixed in with their teas! So you knooow what I had to order--sigh, nostalgia. Ever since then that's the only drink I've ordered. I used to stare at the menu as if I'm going to order something else, but no. Can't help it...I like what like. I love that the strawberry isn't some whack generic tasting syrup pump. This drink you will find bits of strawberries and the essence of strawberry is evident.  I can only give them 4 stars as much as I'd love to hit the 5...but in recent times has been the first time my drink has come out extreeeemely on the water tasting side. No strawberry flavor, not even a black tea hint. Almost as if they were running low of their black tea so they decided to dump more water. The power of dilution.    I bit my tongue a few times until this one time I had my husband return it, in which they gladly remade my drink. It turned out just the way it is supposed to be (thanks to Asia for fixing it for us...which she wasn't the one who originally mixed my drink up by the way). I'm not really a boba kind of gal so I always get half a serving of boba. If I get the full scoop my mouth grows tired of chewing which deflects the enjoyment of my beverage.   Anyway, enough about those chewy balls . They also offer food to accompany your drinks, or food to just munch on as you chill. Yakisoba fries are definitely deelish if you are acquainted to such flavor or is interested in tasting something new. I wasn't too impressed with their bulgogi banh mi simply because I didn't enjoy the way the meat was cooked. I thought the veggies were pretty skim too. The philly cheese steak was ahhhh-ite. However, it isn't a dedicated food joint as their business is about their drinks. They certainly won't disappoint you on that note. The new cookie butter smoothie, yes you read cookie butter smoothie, is addictive! Oh, and the cookies and cream smoothie....drool. I think I have gained some pounds from those smoothies. Well deserved and satisying pounds gained for that matter! You know it's good when someone completely dedicated to one drink all these years goes out her realm, goes to her weekly spot to betray her fave iced tea.   Try it out, enjoy, the staff are great, and when you walk out...you'll be thankful you yelped it.   Also note...you can mix your flavors.

Basically, I don't want my ferocious pace of slurping interrupted by chewy Boba balls that I would probably choke on lol. I don't have time to chew!!  On my first visit, I asked the cashier for a recommendation on something sweet. I went with an Iced Chai Milk Tea. This drink is divine!! If I could drink it everyday, I could. Meanwhile, I just daydream over this drink and fantasize about my next trip to Tea Time to get another Chai Milk Tea. There's a million drinks on the menu but I just can't get enough of the Chai Tea. What if I order something else and it's not as good?? I'm addicted.  My husband gets something new every time. To each his own! We both love the macaroons here, but if you want some, come early because they get wiped out quickly. The fruity pebbles flavor is great!
