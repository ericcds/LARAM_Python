We have family tradition go out celebrate both our birthday. Our birthday family night decided too check out new sushi spot in Henderson on that my brother use too work with the sushi chef Hiro. Always excited too try new restaurants and Tokyo Boys no exception too the rule!  Once got there realize that the location has changed restaurants so many times hard too keep track current one. It in Henderson part of town no venture too very often. I do remember last time some kind of diner. The outside of the building is the same so first glance thinking really sushi restaurant. LIke reading book never judge book by its cover my friends. The first step inside they done great job of changing the decor with little accents too give it more of japanese restaurant. The lantern style lighting all over the restaurant. Soon you walk in instead of your typical dinner sit down counter literally long long row for sushi bar. It very much spacious all around. Ample choices comes too booths, tables, or sushi bar. Inside never think looking from outside be eating japanese restaurant.  It a la carte. Never been fan of comes too sushi but mixing things up is spice of life. We ordered bunch of different things. The Tori karage was delicious. I enjoy the nice crispy skin on the outside and nice moist on the inside. The kakuni or braised pork belly that was keeper! It little bowl filled with goodies. Nice chunks of braised pork that so moist falls apart in your mouth. The sauce more like broth that cooked in along with couple hard boiled eggs. It penetrates literally both the pork and the eggs or perfection. Awesome. Tuna poke salad was ok. One of the things not really that high on had better poke. The spicy yellowtail hand roll. Winnah! Odd but looking at the sushi menu never really had hand roll section. I ask but more then happy too make it.. We had yellowtail with ponzu sauce that was delicious. Few rolls several more dishes. Quality of the fish. I thought it was pretty darn good. The quality was there in all the dishes we had from the sashimi, the sushi rolls, and even had black cod! The presentations for small place outside of strip was really elegant. Most part even though not fan of a la carte the prices are not too bad. You can tell Hiro sushi chef puts his heart and soul into all of his dishes. Hiro easy too talk stories too makes sitting at sushi bar more fun experience. All had great experience here at Tokyo Boys.

When chefs are willing to offer items that don't pander to the common denominator customer I take it as a signal that the chefs care about their food as much as they they care about turning a profit. We are lucky Hiro is this type of chef. If you drink, they have a well curated selection of  uncommon Japanese beers.   For me eating out is sometimes a proxy for travel; seeing something foreign like Umeboshi Chazuke - a shiso, dashi, green tea, rice soup - leaves my giddy with anticipation, imagining I will soon know something more about a place halfway around the world without having to leave Vegas.   Hiro cautioned me that it was a dish unfamiliar to the western palate and that I may want to try something else. Of course, being the pretentious foodie, I took Hiro's polite redirection as a challenge. Is this Chazuke something I will have all the time? No. But, I am glad for the opportunity to try a twist on a common Japanese breakfast and develop my understanding of the flavors within shiso and umeboshi.   Hiro is a Japanese chef who has worked at big name joints on the strip, and thanks to his off strip location and desire to draw in customer we have the chance to enjoy fish that has never been frozen prepared by a skilled chef at off strip prices. If you are wonder why the larger sushi and sashimi prices seem higher than you have seen elsewhere off-strip, it is because these are fish you're only likely to see in places on the strip or at Kabuto.   I was lucky enough to show up on a day when Tuna collar was available. It was larger than I am used too and perfectly grilled. I suspect that the other collars I've had were not butchered in the same manner as this cut. Hiro's decision to butcher the collar a particular way likely contributed to the proper texture of the final dish.    Tokyo Boys does an excellent job of executing both the familiar American sushi as well as the traditional Japanese offerings. I look forward to going back, eating my way through the menu, and trying whatever new items Hiro is excited about serving.", "Date": "2015-08-23", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Chan", "ReviewID": "KqEW1g6inVPPBR6K2NqOGQ", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Sun/16 Aug about 6 pm I was here because the The Great Greek and a Kebab place were closed on Sundays. - Had the 2 item bento box to go which includes rice, salad, tempura (no miso soup when the bento box is take out).

What ever happened to some seasoning? The small and thin slices of pork had no flavor and were dry. They provided a dipping sauce, but I didn't like it since it was too vinegary. I was then looking forward to the kaukuni (pork belly), but that was also dried out. The meat had been simmering in the broth for too long. I did like the agedashi tofu, but I think that's hard to mess up. The service wasn't great, and we had to ask twice for more drinks/refills since the waitress never came by to check on us.

My older two sons and I really like sashimi and nigri, but we only ordered a bit of that; as the rest of our party weren't fans. They were very nice about serving the home made pies my Mom made for my son's birthday, even adding and lighting candles. We are all sushi fans. If you like good sushi, we'd recommend it. It's a solid choice if you have a couple, for example, where one person has been eating sushi for many years and enjoys more of the sashimi, etc., and another person who likes to stick with rolls.

Junko helps us every time we come here (which is very often) and she is THE BEST! She is so sweet and extremely on top of things.

But my wife liked the classy Tokyo Boys logo so we gave it a shot and I'm glad we did.  I think that now when I see a 50's diner I will think of Tokyo Boys.  Now I like the stainless steel look.    We enjoy sitting at the sushi bar and chatting with Hiro, his wife Junko and the other friendly patrons.  Hiro is the owner/chef, which is comforting because he cares about his business and the food he serves.  Sometimes we go for lunch but last night we did a late dinner and stayed until about 01:15 am.  Nice to have a classy late night spot close to home.  I am a fisherman and I always save the collars and belly of my catch.  Those are the best pieces to smoke or broil because they have all the fat and flavor.  I was pleased to see salmon belly and collar on the menu.  The collar is cooked just the way I like it.  The salmon is from Scotland.  Sorry I don't know the Japanese names that well.  I get a seaweed salad to start each meal.  I also like the smelt and flying fish roe with a quail egg over the top!  I tried Uni here for the first time too and it had a pleasant almost sweet after taste.  Hard to describe but it was pretty good.

The plethora of different fish (some were seared/torched lightly which gave a nice smokey flavor) was amazing. I've also never had a Chirashi that has ikura, uni, toro, and a sweet shrimp in it. Absolutely amazing.  Sushi-so it turns out unlike the 90% of other sushi restaurants in the valley, their nigiri is sold individually whereas other places are 2 pieces per order. Their ingredients were extremely fresh, but their prices were a  little  bit higher than what I felt was market value. (This is where I dock half a star) Example: The Uni MP came out to about $7.50 each.  (Don't get me wrong, it was very fresh at least when I got it)  Just to put things into perspective, my take out order for two people came out to just under $76 after tax. If I were to do it all over again, I'd probably order some sort of sushi combo or just go with chirashi's.", "Date": "2016-09-26", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Ermo", "ReviewID": "SqSU3w_tdDVpOtC9b0iHzA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Started the best and still the best!

We walked in hungry, but left full and very satisfied. Eating out is so much about value to price. You can pay more for better omakase in town, but you'll be hard-pressed to find a place that offers as many great cuts of premium fish for $85. Enjoying omakase is also about the experience, and Chef Hiro delivers there too.  When Chef called to confirm the reservation, he asked if we wanted only sushi or a combination of sushi and other small dishes. I told him that we wouldn't mind a lot of sushi, but we're open to whatever he recommends, and whatever thinks is best for us to indulge in. As such, we had a sushi heavy dinner, with a few well-prepared and incredibly tasty small plates. On the sushi side of things, there were four nigiri courses that were all grouped together and made a lot of sense...such as Tuna four ways, and a course with yellowtail, Japanese snapper, and amber jack. As far as the small plates go, Chef presented an Otoro tartare that was absolutely amazing.  Chef Hiro certainly lets his products speak for themselves. He tends to utilize a handful of complimentary ingredients that delivers beautiful flavors time after time...this simple method truly lets the premium ingredients shine, but I was also impressed at the level of Innovation produced from just bringing together four to six ingredients. This really stood out to me in an abalone dish, an aoyagi clam dish, as well as in the Otoro tartare.  I wouldn't hesitate to come back. While Tokyo Boys lacks of the refinement of other Omakase Dinners in town, they make up for it in the amount of beautiful food presented. In fact, I'd recommend them for traditional sushi palettes to enjoy.

My husband and I came here often when it was Ginza sushi and had to venture elsewhere when it closed. Now that Tokyo Boys has opened, we decided to give the restaurant a shot to see how it compared to Ginza so here goes...  I would say Tokyo Boys is overall better than Ginza and most sushi restaurants in the area. For being a  non-Strip  sushi restaurant, it sure does resemble what you would at a Strip location but at a reasonable price. When we arrived, it was very quiet and we were the only patrons in the restaurant. Normally, it's a little nerve-racking to see you're the only people in a restaurant but we took into consideration Tokyo Boys has only been open a few weeks and they do not have signage yet. We were immediately greeted by Junko, their Japanese server, and the sushi chef, who we later discovered is the new owner, Hiro, who is also Japanese. I have yet to visit a Japanese owned sushi restaurant in town so you know this place is going to be good. While we were waiting for some of our order, Hiro was telling us how he has worked for Blue Ribbon at Cosmopolitan and Nobu at Hard Rock Hotel and he orders his fish from the same vendors that the above restaurants do; the only difference is that he makes the price of the sushi affordable but still having quality. He preached having quality in what he serves and the sushi definitely proved it.  Here's a description of what we enjoyed:  Tekka Maki with Avocado (Tuna roll with Avocado) - AMAZING is all I can say. The tuna was beyond fresh and melted in our mouths. We could already tell from looking at the sushi it was fresh from how red it was. This could be because Hiro receives a shipment of fish every other day rather than once a week like many other restaurants in town. This roll was only $6.50! Definitely worth the quality!  Zuke Maguro - This is Tuna sashimi drizzled with a ginger type dressing then topped with fresh wasabi. It was amazing - I am obsessed with the tuna they serve here.  Japanese Eggplant - He gave this to us to try since I do not like American eggplant and would never order anything that said eggplant but this dish was really good. I was really surprised!  Spicy Tuna Roll - Hiro makes a tuna roll then drizzles the spicy sauce on top so it doesn't take away from the fresh taste of the fish. It's not mashed together like at other restaurants so you know you're actually getting tuna. So good!  Negihama Roll - The Yellowtail was soft and melted in our mouths - no other way to describe it.  Shrimp Tempura Roll - They make the shrimp tempura made to order so it's not just sitting out all day. You can taste the crunch in every bite and it wasn't drowning in eel sauce.  Miso Soup - Tokyo Boys makes their Miso soup from scratch and doesn't use the packets like other restaurants so the soup is a lot lighter and you can taste the difference. The soup isn't as salty and is actually really refreshing. There's a whole process Hiro has with making the soup he can share if you ask him about it.  Cold Sake - He gave us a sample of cold sake (shame on me for not remembering the name) but it was really good! You could barely taste any alcohol in it and went down smoothly.  With a couple duplicates in our order, for two people, we spent around $50 not including gratuity. We were satisfied in the meal where we weren't hating ourselves from eating too much but not hungry. It was the perfect amount of food for the price and quality. We will be dining at Tokyo Boys once a week from now on.

So let me review...  First this place is a tad on the pricy side for what you get. Portions are not that big for what they are charging. I guess we are used to the LA and OC sushi places we normally eat at. But the food does taste fresh and is well made.   The Sashimi was fresh and the best thing we had there. Got the Salmon, Smoked Salmon and the fatty Tuna, aka Toro Tuna. But again a little pricy for what you get.   The Grilled Salmon was good and fresh. Came on a bed of tempura and teriyaki sauce. Simple yet good dish.   The Roppongi roll was fair. For $15.00 I was expecting a little more of a spectacular taste but it was average. I've had better signature rolls from other Sushi joints. This was supposed to be one of their best and most popular rolls but we thought it was mediocre at best.   What we did like was the Fresh Wasabi that came with the Sashimi. First time I've had that in a sushi place in Vegas.   Finally the Katsu Curry was very tasty and a decent sized portion. It's definitely not on the generous portion size that you would get in LA. But still good.   We were surprised this place was open so late because we were the only ones in there haha. It was a desolate Thursday night with no cars on the road or other guests inside.

The first mouthful of the medium fatty tuna sent me into sushi bliss and was an ideal way to kick off dinner.  Other exceptional nigiri pieces included the incredible cut of hamachi, the oyster whose plumpness and juiciness was greatly accentuated by the Chef steaming it with sake for fifteen minutes, and the homemade uber-tender tako.

I hate to say it, but to me it seemed they were more interested in them because a) they were spending a lot of money and b)the racial difference, they were laughing and speaking in japanese, and maybe they were regulars? It just really seemed they didn't care about us because of a racial difference.   As far as the food goes, it was delicious. I got two rolls that were both pretty satisfying.

Drinks were refilled often and plates were cleared frequently. I also liked that the sushi was served as the orders came up instead of waiting until all of the rolls were ready.   I started with edamame and a small house salad. I liked the dressing on the salad and that it was made with leafy greens. The edamame was pretty good.   Our first roll was the Spider Roll. It was pretty good, but the portion was small. Next up was the White Tiger roll which was my favorite. This roll was a little larger and I loved the flavors and sauces. Lastly, we had the Blue Crab Roll which was on special. I didn't care for this, but my husband loved it.   The food was decent, but I thought the price was high for the quality and portions.

I order sushi to go at least once - sometimes twice a week from here and whenever family visits my husband and I will take them here and they always love it.   My favorite things to order are the toro, spicy tuna rolls, salmon, and their teriyaki chicken is to die for with the tempura fried veggie strings it's served on.

Here's the story:  We were headed to the bank and the auto mall to run some errands. Lo and behold, we see this shiny old school diner building to the left. So we jump to you yelp app and see that it's a sushi restaurant. As most of my followers know I am skeptic when it comes to Japanese food outside of the motherland it something told me that we need to check this place out. (Well the previous reviews helped a little).  there was only a few people at the bar when we arrived. I am not one for the sushi bar so we opted for a booth. Service was fast and friendly; as you would come to expect in a Japanese establishment.    I glanced at the special board and they had: O-Toro Chu-Toto I knew that we were in for a real Japanese treat! Here is what we ordered by round:  Round 1 Agaedashi tofu: Firm toru with a nice fried skin, topped with negi (green onion) just like you would find in the Motherland.   Negitoro Temaki Freshly made negitoro, the fish was bright pink and garnished with fresh wasabi.  Round 2 Sirloin steak:  Served on a hot plate garnished with a grip of onions. Nothing to write home about. I didn't come here for the steak; I came for sushi.   Negitoro Gyunkan (my fave item): It's not on the menu but they were happy to make it! Same quality as the temaki roll    Chu-toro Probably my favorite grade. Right in the middle of the grades. Quick Japanese lesson: The Chu prefix means mid; so in this case mid grade toro.  It's not too delicate like O-Toro but not solid like akami (normal grade).   O-toro: I am not a big O-Toro fan but figured if it's on they have it, I'm going to eat it. The fish was just as expected nice a buttery.   Round 3: Gyoza: Fresh and handmade! What more can you ask for?  Japanese Lasagna Roll: I didn't order it; the GF did. I am not a fan of suped up sushi with cream cheese so this was a miss for me. BUT the GF liked it....    More Negitoro gyunkan  Uni: You have to be a fan of uni to want to eat it. The uni here was ok.. Sorry I am spoiled from living in Northern Japan where they are known for their sweet fresh uni. It was the sweetest that I've had in the valley so far.   Akami:  As mentioned previously; its the bright red tuna that everyone is accustomed to.  Bright red, soft and fresh! So refreshing after eating so much mediocre frozen Vegas buffet sushi.    Be sure that you don't com hungry as the aforementioned food will run you easily around $100. BUT TRUST ME, ITS WORTH EVERY PENNY! Some of the freshest fish and most authentic sushi that I've had next to Miko's Izakaya (which I still love too!)

However you can't order the same meats (no doubles) for some odd reason, it has to be 2 different meats. I still ended up ordering it however I just ordered 2 bento meals with teriyaki chicken and chicken katsu and just switched the meats myself.. The chicken katsu was super dry and the teriyaki chicken had no teriyaki sauce and was burnt. The only part of the meal that tasted as it should was the rice. My husband got two rolls despite the price however wasn't satisfied either. I don't mind high price sushi, but it better taste damn good if you are going to charge a high price.

Tried this place for the first time yesterday and I'm soo mad that I didn't get to take any pictures cause my phone died :(   Soo if you know this area, you know that this place went through several owners like Bernard's Bistro and thus we get a shiny silver diner Japanese place Lol. I'm happy that the chef and sushi chef were both Japanese so that's a plus. We decided to share a whole bunch of items: braised pork belly (kakuni), Japanese fried chicken (karaage), seaweed salad, eel bowl (unagi don), a dragon roll and tempura ice cream.  Kakuni: wasn't what I was expecting but it was delicious. Super tender, came served in a bowl with rich broth and eggs.  Chicken Karaage: always a favorite of mine, super light and salty in a good way. Came with about 6-7 pieces.  Seaweed Salad: Soo good. I hate when a place makes it super dry but here they make it perfectly with the right balance of sesame oil, vinegar, sugar and soy sauce.  Unagi Don: a little on the pricey side compared to everything else at $18 but it is soo worth it. I have not seen such great quality eel probably since I left Okinawa. Super tender, probably about 6-7 pieces with each piece being two fingers in width. Yummy! Served with too much rice but honestly I haven't had an unagi don anywhere with a  normal  amout of rice lol  Dragon Roll: a pet peeve of mine was that it wasn't rolled tight enough, some pieces fell apart a little. They used a good amount of ingredients and not a ridiculous amount of rice so that's good. The eel on top was the same quality we got on the unagi don yumm. However I feel the sushi rice was made a little too sweet for my taste.  Tempura ice cream: we had the vanilla even though they offer a green tea version. The perfect ending, cold and warm and the tempura actually tasted like yellow cake Lol so good.   Oh and they offer Orion beer! & at $8 for a liter! If you've never tried, it's an Okinawan light beer, kind of like a mix between Bodington's & Chang's beer.  The atmosphere is very casual, very...unjapanese lol looked like a diner still with bits of Asian flair but it was very clean and the food was good so no problem! I just wouldn't make coming here a first-date type of option.

We enjoyed salmon nigiri, spicy tuna, and a variety of others on the menu that I don't remember... but all of the fish was fresh and tasted wonderful.   Overall.... such a pleasant experience. I would fly down to Vegas from Oregon just for this. I recommend this place over and over and over.... GO HERE.  Note: Sushi restaurants are normally not open during the afternoons. They close around 1 or 2pm and open back up for dinner. This is normal and necessary to maximize profits as a small business. Also, being in the high desert, Sushi isn't going to be cheap.

It took months upon months, as well as a long brainstorming session when my friend finally decided to go for Japanese and I searched out the nearby Japanese restaurants on Yelp.  Tokyo Boys has the body of a 50's diner, the guts of a nice casual restaurant, and the soul of a good sushi restaurant. They're only open for dinner and they're closed on Mondays. The menu has a variety of cooked and cold dishes, plus nigiri served one piece at a time, and a relatively limited selection of special rolls. Plus, they offer daily special fresh fish until they run out.  To start the meal, they serve a small complimentary cucumber salad with a sweet and sour dressing. It was a delicious way to distract my stomach while waiting. My order also came with miso soup, which was a bit lighter but definitely less salty than typical versions of the soup. It was also enjoyable.  I went with Stefany V's recommendation of the Tokujyo Chirashi ($28), or Premium Assorted Sashimi Bowl. In contrast to what you'll sometimes get in chirashi bowls, this one has good slices of fish that are closer to what I've seen in sashimi cuts than the modest nigiri portions. In portion size alone, the vinegar rice and fish make this a solid value. There's actually so much fish that it was hard to reach the rice below without shifting a lot of fish first. Anyway, by the end, I felt quite stuffed in an almost AYCE-like fashion.  The upshot is that the sashimi was quite good, whether it was a small portion (like the 1 piece of albacore) or large portion (like 3 pieces of tuna). I was not dissatisfied with any of the cuts, even the masago-covered fish. Favorites included ikura (salmon roe), amaebi (sweet shrimp, both the body and the fried head), maguro (tuna), hamachi (yellowtail), sake (salmon), hotate (scallop), and saba (mackerel, at worst my 2nd favorite ever). Other pieces included lobster, crab, unagi (eel, but without eel sauce), ebi (shrimp), albacore, tako (octopus), smoked salmon, and tamago (sweet egg, which my friend remarked is a 9/10 that's only less soft compared to what he's had in Japan). As the chef remarked, this chirashi has everything in the case.  I had to try out dessert too, so I picked the green tea cheesecake ($4.50), which the menu states is served parfait-style. It comes in a plastic cup and it's pretty fantastic. The slightly salty crust at the bottom, the smooth and flavorful yet relatively light cheese cake, and the top layer of subtle but present green tea mousse made a wonderful combination that I actually prefer to the renditions of cheesecake served at a certain Japanese pastry shop in the Southwest.  Service was a bit iffy, with the one server seemingly stretched thing among the several tables. I had to wave her down after several idle (non-eating) minutes to get my dessert, and she took a while to swipe my credit card too. I wouldn't go here if I were hurting for time.  Tokyo Boys might not shape up as the best sushi spot if you try to compare them to the value meccas found all over the Las Vegas area, or the premium restaurants serving pieces curated with painstaking care. However, it's a very good restaurant that at the very least serves raw fish with superior-to-AYCE quality, and it's located in the Henderson area.

It irks me when I see negative reviews on this place because of a biased, unfortunate experience that seems to usually be, the person's fault them self.   First off, the sushi is the best! Before I ever had food from this place, I was a fond, avid eater of  all you can eat sushi . It was cheap and what seemed good to me when I was ignorant about food. All this sushi for a cheap price? I was in! But that's because I never had authentic, quality sushi.  When it comes to getting raw fish, I have 3 top orders here. Either a Roppongi roll, a sushi combination, or the famous Tokujyo Chirashi. What I get depends on how hungry I am and what I feel like.  If I want a roll, the Roppongi is my go-to. I'm a big tuna lover and this roll has spicy tuna and shrimp inside while still being topped with regular tuna. On top of that, this roll bursts with flavor! It has like a garlic ponzu and masago (smelt roe) on top that adds that extra  mmmf .  If I feel like sushi, I'll get a combo; 7 pieces if I'm not too hungry, 12 pieces if I'm feeling ballsy. Anyways, it's perfect because it comes with a variety of fresh, sushi from quality fish that melts in your mouth and aside from the amount of pieces you get, it also comes with a roll of your choice from the 4 roll list options! I get it with a spicy tuna and mmmm so yummy! *On that note* the spicy tuna rolls here aren't minced weird mixtures of tuna, they're actually slices of tuna with spicy mayo! Nothing better than real, yummy tuna!  Then if I'm feeling super hungry and craving for a huge variety of fish, I get the Tokujyo Chirashi. This dish is a bowl of rice, topped with almost every fish in the restaurant, even Uni! I've never been a fan of Uni but since I've tried it here, there are days when I'll just crave it alone. Not only that, along with the sushi combos, it comes with miso soup! Which is the best miso soup I've ever had because they make it fresh in the restaurant from the  mugi miso  plant.  Before this meal, I might get an appetizer (which could be a meal but share it and you got you and your friends a delightful app)! With that, it will either be the Karaage or Salt and Pepper shrimp.  I'm a HUGE lover of fried chicken and I'd have to say, the Karaage (Japanese style fried chicken) here, is some of the best fried, let alone CHICKEN, I've ever had. It's marinated when ordered then deep fried and topped with salt and pepper. I don't know what it is about the salt and pepper at this place but it definitely has a different taste of spice to it. I take my 1 year old niece here with me often and she loves this chicken as much as I do.   With the salt and pepper shrimp, the flavoring is similar but it's shrimp instead, also with jalapeños for a little spiciness on top. Not only that, the shrimp is soft shell so you can eat the whole thing! It's different and delicious!  There's many desserts here that are a hidden gem because it seems most people don't talk about them. Junko (owner and waitress), homemakes some of the desserts and I'd have to say, her Green Tea Cheesecake is my all time favorite.  The Green Tea Cheesecake is not sliced, but cheesecake in a cup instead. With that, it's different because it's a nice mousse, instead of the heavy cheesecake we're used to. Also, I'm a matcha (real green tea) fanatic, so when I taste the matcha in this cake, it brings me joy. The whole thing altogether is like sweet serenity.  Overall, the quality, value, service and experience is one of a kind. There's a reason why I always come back, maybe you will too.", "Date": "2016-01-30", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Carly", "ReviewID": "CYvb2gWeoNHSglci4P-Ysw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "11.30.13.  Who would have thought, an authentic Japanese restaurant, smack-dab in the middle of nowhere (as it seemed) somewhere in Vegas. I know walking in here I was a bit skeptical...  Our family came here on a whim, since it was the closest & highly recommended via Yelp. But upon arrival, the 50's diner exterior (red/silver trim, white tile) took me by surprise & def left me wondering if this place was for real/legit.  Since we were hungry, we decided to just stick with it & give it a try...and good thing we did! We all loved our meals & this place does live up to the standards of good, Japanese cuisine in my book. It is run by Japanese owners who appeared to be able to speak Japanese as well!  When we entered, the restaurant was empty except for another couple sitting in another booth. These owners kept the 50's feel of the diner, but changed the color palette to a dark, rich colors (think eggplant). There are both (50's style) booths & a sushi bar.  I believe we all ordered teishoku-type meals with either two or three choices (~$15). I went with the teriyaki salmon & assorted tempura (2 shrimp, onion, eggplant, sweet potato, jalepeno, & a mushroom); this also came with miso soup, rice & salad with an ethnic dressing (that I wasn't really a fan of...sort of a grainy, green sour/sweet dressing). Prior to our meals we also ordered a roll as an appetizer; the Yum Yum roll (~$8?), a mixture of crab, lobster & scallops with tobiko...I think it was also spicy...  Overall, we were very happy with the quality & taste of our meals! The other Yelpers were right in lauding this restaurant for it's tempura! It really was light, fluffy, & not oily or heavy at all!! Service here was also great. Although it was not crowded we were still catered to as things got slightly busier & I noticed that even though the restaurant was technically supposed to close 30 minutes after we arrived, we were not rushed or pushed out.

They have high quality green tea, matcha, and they refill with no extra cost, ok snooze I know but had to include it. We love love the takosu, it's cucumber cut beautifully and meticulously to soak up the sweet rice vinegar, a little bit of seaweed salad and tender tako (octopus). This tako got the deep tissue massage, it's not that tough stuff you'll find at cheaper sushi joints, just soft and chewy, with lemon. Beautiful! So beautiful we eat it before we think to take a picture. Off of the sushi menu my bf always gets the garlic tuna, which looks amazing, he assures me it is, but I can't indulge due to an allergy. I always get the hamachi Kama, or amberjack Kama if they are out, it is sooo good. In case you don't know Kama is the  collar  of a fish, and it is delicious. It's a soft white fish, moist with some fattier parts by the bones. It melts in your mouth. It comes grilled with a slightly crispy skin and moist tender inside. Served with finely chopped green onion, lemon and a ponzu sauce I believe. That one is a winner. My bf gets the rib eye steak off of the grill menu with the teriyaki sauce, the sauce comes on the side and the steak comes out sizzling on a cast iron skillet. It's always cooked wonderfully and he loves their sauce as well. We've tried a few desserts which were all tasty, I recommend the yuzu sorbet. It is light and refreshing, perfect ending to a meal.", "Date": "2015-06-10", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Stephanie", "ReviewID": "FGMdT2pIPykw2uW6NvC_9Q", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Just updated from 3(3.5!) to 4 stars.

Chef Hiro takes great pride in his craft, and it shows in his cuisine. The focus is more traditional Japanese cuisine than fusion elements (I.e. nigiri and maki vs some  I love my ass  role you'll find at ayce establishments), however you'll still be able to get the latter as desired.  It is important to note that Tokyo Boys is not AYCE, and as such you'll spend more here. In return, you'll get a right & proper meal. The fish is fresh and never frozen, and much of it arrives the same day from Japan via Honolulu (they use the same suppliers as many of the $$$$ sushi establishments on the Strip). I suspect that the (very few) negative reviewers don't take this into account, and may not have a true appreciation for the genuine article. Their loss.

It's best if you ask the waitress what the chef is recommending that evening because they serve only what is freshly available. So, some days they have blue fin, other days it may be yellow fin.

Dined in on Friday night around 11PM. We ordered 3pc of the shigoku oysters - It's part of their daily specials. I was looking for this last time I was here since I saw pictures of it on yelp but couldn't find it on the menu. I only had a chance to try one because I wasn't quick enough, boyfriend gobbled down the other 2 but it was good!  Also ordering from their specials, we got 2 pieces of the amberjack sushi and 2 pieces of the wagyu beef. Both were sooo delicious. The amberjack was topped with what appeared and tasted like fresh wasabi which complimented the fish. And the wagyu had this great texture and quality taste.  They didn't have the hamachi collar this time when we went but we got the salmon collar and it was just as good! The salmon was cooked perfectly, it had great grill marks on the outside which made the skin crispy but retained a lot of moisture on the inside. The fish practically fell off the bone as we went for it. We also got the 9 piece sashimi and then decided we were still hungry and asked for a recommendation on rolls - we got the roppongi roll and it seriously got better with each piece I had. I knew I would love the collar, I knew I would love the wagyu beef and the sashimi, but I was skeptical about any of their rolls which is why I didn't order any last time and wasn't planning to this time. So at first I was like okay, this is okay but eventually I found myself wanting more - so I stopped eating the collar just to focus more of my efforts on the roll. It's a spicy tuna and shrimp roll with tuna and smelt eggs on top. The sauce that they have accompany it is so good.

Japanese cuisine is by far our favorite. We normally have to drive to the west side as we do not really enjoy any of the local places. It was a nice surprise to finally find a place closer to my house that met our expectations.  This restaurant has authentic Japanese cuisine. The quality of their products are on par with restaurants on the strip at affordable prices. The decor is not Japanese and does not serve justice to the place. It is extremely clean and kept very fresh. Our town needs more family owned and operated restaurants like this that have a home feel unmatched by the big corporation places.  Definitely try their oysters, tempura uni, monkfish liver, pork belly and their amazing sushi. My daughter and I went with Omakase Menu and enjoyed every course. The menus also have more conservative alternatives for people like my wife, that are equally delicious.

I decided to pop in on a Saturday to see what kind of lunch specials were available (currently Yelp says this business is closed on weekends, that is not correct, they are open Saturdays but not Sundays). I was greeted by my waitress and took a seat at the bar where the sushi chef welcomed me.   I ended up getting the sushi lunch special: 5 pieces of sushi, my choice of a spicy tuna or California roll (I went with the tuna) and a bowl of miso soup. I asked the sushi chef what sushi came with the lunch special, and he said if I had specific fish I wanted he'd try to accommodate me, so I was able to have some delicious scallop.   My miso soup came out first, I was still warm from being out in the heat that morning so I didn't eat much of it. As other reviews have mentioned, this is made from scratch and you can really taste the difference.  I did not have a long wait for my sushi.. Sadly, I was a tad disappointed right off the bat. I had read another review explaining that Tokyo Boys does the spicy tuna roll differently than other places, with the spicy sauce on top instead of mashing the tuna and sauce together before making the roll. I am not sure if it is because it was part of the lunch special, but my spicy tuna roll was all mashed up. The taste was fine, I was just expecting to be served the same spicy tuna roll I saw in the other reviewer's photos. My nigiri was good... Not blow-your-mind amazing but good size cuts of fairly fresh fish and a good rice/fish ratio.   Hindsight is 20/20... I probably would have been happier if I ordered rolls, which it seems like most of the people raving about this place did. I don't see myself rushing back to Tokyo Boys, but will probably give them another try eventually.", "Date": "2013-08-03", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Paulina", "ReviewID": "DXpeZLFbd0CKC2Rob8zTMg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Abosultely amazing Sushi!

When she finally returned, we explained that we saw on the menu that they do have soft shell crab and we would like the dragon roll with soft shell crab instead of imitation crab, she huffily disappeared again only to return to tell us that they would charge us $20 for the roll if we wanted real crab, so we said no thanks. The rolls we did order were good and the fish was fresh, but it was no fresher or better than any local AYCE place. We were terribly disappointed with the service, quality, prices, and selection. If you're in the area looking for a sushi place, go down the street to Momo.  Way better, cheaper, and better service and selection. Oh, and the first time we tried to go to tokyo boys they were closed even though their hours on the door said they were open, and yelp said they were open.

The portion is smaller than other AYCE sushi places but it's because their fish is fresh.   Why do I love this place? Because this place serves the freshest food. For example, I got the Tiger roll, which consists of spicy tuna, avocado, and shrimp tempura. The avocado was cut in front of us rather than being already cut and have left in the refrigerator. Also the shrimp tempura was crispy and warm. Usually, other sushi places, the tempura is cold so it really doesn't compare to this one.   Also the server/hostess seems to be attentive which is nice. This place should get more people because it's a hidden gem!

There was no ice or refrigeration visible anywhere on it. It was this way before we got there and remained that way after we left. I assume that is just how they roll.  So...yay for dangerous raw food temps!  I got 2 spicy tuna rolls. Ordering a spicy tuna  roll at a sushi place is like getting a burger at McDonald's. It is the basic roll. Common, you should know what to expect.   These rolls I got were loose, the fish was warmish, the spicy sauce was dribbled over the roll and not inside, and there was nothing else in the roll at all except tuna. It was bland and bad-tasting.   I also got tempura shrimp & veggies. These weren't awful, but they were nothing special. In all honesty they were a little under fried.  My wife got some sort of shrimp dish with jalapeños on it. There was not enough good for her. We had to get tacos afterwards. And no, she isn't large and is not a big eater.
