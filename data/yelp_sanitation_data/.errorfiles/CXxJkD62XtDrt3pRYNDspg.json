When I arrived, he wanted Johnny Rocket's instead.  I had read all about Capriott's on Yelp, so I was excited to try it.  I begrudgingly agreed to eat at Johnny Rocket's, but it turned out to be a great meal and experience.  The staff were super friendly at Johnny Rocket's.  Especially the girl with the big blue eyes.  She answered all of my many questions that I had because I hadn't been to Johnny Rocket's often.  She filled me on their new food items that I was totally unfamiliar with.  After talking to her, I decided on the Philly Cheesesteak with fries.  It was super tasty, and I was glad to have ordered it.  It turned out to be an unexpectedly excellent meal.  It honestly felt weird to be on vacation at a place like Las Vegas with a million restaurants around and eating at Johnny Rockets.  However, I was glad that I did.  I had a great experience and would not mind coming here again the next time I am in the area.", "Date": "2014-01-29", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Robert", "ReviewID": "aT23BsJNoXY-Xp3aCOE2_g", "Overall": "1", "Content": "We went here on Memorial weekend for lunch and it was pretty empty. (that should have said enough). The staff is young and increadibly inexperienced, spoke very broken english and made us feel like we were a burden. I am usually as cool as a cucumber when it comes to restaurants and staff but something was really off at this location. If there was a manager it did not show. They were out of root beer and orange crush so I just stuck with water. 4 out of the 6 glasses were filthy, and after asking if we could get new ones we were immed. treated like we thought we were royalty. A few minutes later I get a look directly from the cook. Thats when I asked the fam if they would rather walk across the street to Hard Rock. Needless to say maybe the staff at this location should have lunch at the HR cafe and see how things should be.

FOOD - 1 Star: I ordered:  - Chili Cheese Fries: These were ok. They were really heavy on the chili and the cheese was barely there. It would've been way better to actually have the cheese on the top instead of under the chili.  - Sweet Potato Bacon Cheese Fries: I enjoyed the sweet potato fries myself, but the cheese... if you can call it that... was pretty disgusting. I don't know why they couldn't use real cheese. Instead they used some liquid cheese that you'd find at the movie theater and so it had this weird taste to it. The only thing that kind of saved it was the bacon, but even that was overpowered by the liquid cheese. This ruined my appetite and I had to eat around the cheese, which was almost impossible since it was all over the place.  - Smoke House Single Burger: This was pretty good, but smaller than I thought it would be. Maybe I don't come here often enough, but the burger was small. The taste was spot on. You can't go wrong with a meat patty, cheese, onion rings, and bacon.  SERVICE - 2 Stars: The staff was friendly, but literally only approached us to drop off the menus and to deliver food. No one checked on us at all during the meal. I need an extra fork and literally had to flag someone down to get it.  ATMOSPHERE - 2 Stars: It's your typical Johnny Rocket's setup and my biggest issue with the place was the fact there was no soap in the restroom. I'm glad we had hand sanitizer with us, but that's just gross.  RECOMMENDATION: Overall, I'd say you can skip this place. Go to Capriotti's or Joe's Pizza in the same shopping center instead. You'll get way better food for the money you're paying.", "Date": "2014-03-10", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Christopher", "ReviewID": "jzXYZDm-ZZsVWQ20AzOGYg", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Three Words:  No Air Conditioning  I was in town a week ago for an event and some friends of mine decided to go Johnny Rockets for some dinner grub.

I literally sat down for less than 20 seconds and didn't even have my purse off of my shoulder before our server was hounding us for a drink order. Having never been there, I had to quickly glance at the menu which listed Pepsi products, so I ordered a pepsi. She then tells me that they only have Coke products. (??) So Coke it is, fine.  She returns a minute later ready to take our lunch order and proceeds to explain the Manager's special is  The Original .  Again, 1st time there, so I order the special and she asks if I would like everything on the burger.  Everything BUT mustard, I tell her. My Husband orders a patty melt.  Food arrived and I literally had a mustard soaked burger.  We tell the manager, who apologizes (although I'm feeling this was not out of sincerity, but rather obligation) and offers to make another burger.  But I explain that I am on my lunch break and do not have enough time to wait for another burger to be prepared, eat it, and travel back to work.  The server also then comes over and apologizes.  Fine.  I ate less than 40% of the burger that had the least amount of mustard on it.  There was so much of it that it was literally on my rings, and my fingers were yellow, no joke!  Then the bill arrives and I couldn't believe that there was no offer of a discount whatsoever.  What a poor first (and last) trip to Johnny Rockets.

I didn't really enjoy their burgers, I feel like I could better burgers at in & out for a cheaper price.   The times where I have eaten there, the service was okay no one really paid much attention to us. It was basically ordered our meal and then paid for our meal.    The place is like a 1950s diner which was pretty cool and they even had a cute little jukebox that you can put your money in and play some 50s music.

It was refreshing to get out and walk here.  When we got there, we seated ourselves and our server came over and made us feel welcome and at home, though we were hundreds of miles away from home.  I enjoyed being in the 1950's diner vibe because those were the better days of food service compared to the more corporate feel you get today.  So, when it came time to placing our order, my friend and I each got Rocket Doubles and a side of onion rings to share and I got a bowl of chili for myself.  At first, we thought that we didn't order enough food and then it showed up and we began eating it.  Toward the end of the meal, we realized that it was definitely a lot of food and we were really hungry when we showed up.  We barely finished our burgers and then the last of the onion rings which then left us bursting at the seams.  Overall, the food was really good and something different from the offerings at HRH.  I think our total came out to $30 with tip so it wasn't that expensive compared to what you would get at most hotels.

As a kid growing up Johnny Rockets was my favorite place to go to. I always loved their hotdogs, burgers, shakes and chili cheese fries!!! Well, today my BF and I decided to come by and revisit our childhood memories for dinner with an old fashioned burger, fries and shake. He ordered the smokehouse burger and I ordered the spicy chipotle chicken burger while we shared regular fries and a chocolate banana shake. Well, if you see the picture I uploaded of my burger, you can see the photo of how it should've looked like right next to it. 1, the menu said it was romaine lettuce...well it was iceberg that I got. 2. The chicken on the photo looked seasoned and amazing...the chicken I got was completely flavorless and barely cooked thoroughly I could barely tell if it was healthy so I didn't finish it. Good thing my BF enjoyed his burger and our shake was actually good. As for the fries... Let's talk about them while I also talk about the service.   Service was very very slow. Food took look to make and then throughout the meal, when we would want our waitress's attention, she was doing other things keeping her from seeing us. Our waters never got refilled. AND we nearly finished our burgers and we had to question if our fries were on their way to find out she forgot them. After when we finished and wanted the check, it was so hard trying to get her attention, it took forever to get it.   Overall, we were disappointed and will probably leave our great memories of Johnny Rockets as kids in our head and maybe not be back unless we're craving for a decent milkshake", "Date": "2015-04-12", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Margret", "ReviewID": "jP1Em_t8yJSvKXFmEIpJ5w", "Overall": "4", "Content": "The original location- been here about five times- solid place.

Oh yea --- sounds like porn....But Tastier! The fries and onion rings here are pretty good too! But Chili Cheese fries....mmmmm. Johnny Rockets also serves shakes.

I have never received this level of rude service, this takes the cake as number 1 worst experience.

I can understand a bad day but this was ridiculous. I walked away not eating and vowing never to come back. Horrible service and mishandling of the food.     My fiancee and I decided to walk across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel and noticed Johnny Rockets to grab a quick bit. We weren't greeted but still sat down at the counter to eat, still no greet but luckily there was a menu available. So we waited about ten minutes as I observed three servers on shift. Finally, the gentlemen server approaches the couple next to us and says  I see no one took your order yet  it was pretty rude but true. After he took their order, I asked  can I please place my order as well as I've been waiting,he replied  I'll try . He then takes the order and walks away to the back. So we waited another 10 minutes, I ask the tall waitress with red hair  can I please get a water  she gets it and slams it down. The couple next to us asked for their drinks and the waitress said  I didn't take your order so what do you want . So about another 15 minutes passed, in that time I observed the cook on his phone and then heading back to the grill without washing hands, bacon that wasn't properly cooked from a previous order placed on another order. I didn't walk away then. So I wanted to check the status of my order so I asked another server (short female w/black hair)about my order, she went to check and came back to say  who assisted you  I described the gentlemen with the glasses. She asked him about the order and he replied  transfer the checks, I'm out . To hear that upset me, I spoke my frustration  to the wrong employee.

Many of the orders were wrong.  One person ordered  No Onions . The burger had onions. She asked to have another one with no onions... They scrapped them off and gave it back to her... You could smell it... It was honestly insulting.  I really assumed that a national chain, located across the street from a major resort would have some standards and/or some self respect, but no... They really just did not care about how anything was presented.  My chicken club featured a pathetic piece of meat, charred bacon and flavorless tomatoes. The sandwich was around $8 and included no side, no even a pickle.  Not to be vulgar, but I was in the bathroom right after leaving...

Went there after doing some miniature golfing and got seated, and the waitress promptly took our drink/shake orders. She came back awhile later and asked us what we wanted to eat, all the while asking us again what our shake/drink orders were.  She then brought out our shake orders one every 5 minutes but not in any rhyme or reason. She took to sniffing every milk shake to see which one was which and still giving us the wrong ones. (which was a little scary cause we had someone allergic to bananas and one of the friends had ordered a chocolate banana shake).   One of the glasses had food on the inside of it so we asked to have it remade, but pretty sure they just dumped the shake in a to go cup and added new whip cream on top.   Then came the orders.....fries came out before actual entrees, people were getting the wrong burgers. Some didn't even get their burgers and we waited an hour. (there were only two other tables taken so there was hardly anyone there). They brought my order out and it had onions on it (which I said I can't have) and I sent it back. They brought it back out and it was the exact same burger! All they did was take the onions off! Seriously? You can't do a remake and make things right?   By that point we had had enough as we had sent back three burgers cause they were wrong and two people still hadn't gotten their food.   On top of that they were just a dumb staff and didn't know what they were doing. I wish that things could have gone better or that I could have liked their food but after all of this I really doubt that I will even give johnny rockets a second glance.", "Date": "2012-09-09", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Arnel", "ReviewID": "USPsZue5ZzDUOfRfBfqnsg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Fully loaded burgers for cheap late night in Vegas!!!", "Date": "2011-08-14", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "M", "ReviewID": "SRGbLNdmLoGygg5AVJ2oPA", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Pretty good but over priced.

It was delicious! The shake was thick and well worth the money.

Both with big appetites they loved their meals.  I got a water, strawberry Oreo shake, and chicken fingers with the half fries half onion rings basket.  As the onion rings and fries were more to have a complete meal, we all actually shared just one basket.  The burgers were priced right for their size and the amount of toppings.  One of the boys was unable to finish his double western cheese burger and the other devoured their burger with jalapeños.  My chicken fingers were okay.   I didn't like the flavor of the breading, it was a bit salty in an off putting way.  Everything was served hot and our waiter was very attentive with refills and bringing out our food together.

Ruby's, Fatburger (although not that themed) and Johnny Rockets. The first and last are more restaurants then fast food however.   I have recently visited the Johnny Rocket's across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel and like always, I thoroughly enjoyed my time. However, as some posters have stated, you do pay a premium for the atmosphere. This is not a  quick and cheap  burger like McDonald's, but more of an experience. Something you may only do once every two months.   The woman that helped me was kind and courteous and I wish I could remember her name. She was quick and attentive and on top of her game when it came to refilling my drink. My last go at the eatery was a Chicken Club Sandwich, with 1/2 and 1/2 fries and onion rings. Splitting the rings and fries is great, but I sometimes wish I had more rings, so maybe next time, I will get the rings alone.   I have also noticed some new menu items (at least new to me). One of these items is a cobb salad and I can see that as a big seller if people aren't interesting in eating red meat (or turkey burgers).

We walked in to staff yelling Welcome to Johnny Rockets yey it seemed like a party! A party for ME! So I was excited when the cook yelled find a seat anyplace you like. I thought Oooo! So I went over to where I wanted to sit and the husband followed. Once in the booth that was all mine I put down my coach bag and pulled out my phone and checked in and gave a tip on yelp.com then it happen.  He walked over gave us menus and lord he was such a downer. Hello he said I said Hi. Can I ask you a question he said if a girl breaks up with you after you buy her a apple 5 phone and then text you weeks later and said she was thinking about you would you take her back?  I replied NO you must love your self and anyone willing to drop you is not for you. But I can tell your gonna take her back because if you and I were on the same page you would not be messing with me doing my dinner time to bug me about some girl who don't want u. She texted you and said she was thinking about you not that she wanted you back. Find a church and something better to do with your time because this girl is not for u. He laughed and said other people have told him the same thing. So I took a moment to pat myself on the back. I told him hey other people and I cant be wrong. If a million people are telling you something must be some truth to it.  After that he went on and on about this girl about 20 mins later He's using profanity like he's not at work and I said to myself he has 3 mins to get away from my table before I ask to talk to his manager.    I was able to get him to bring our burger fires and onion rings (Please see my pictures) Now the husband ate his food soon as it got their. I on the other hand had to see my food go from hot to room temp because skippie or whatever his name is ugh Is still going on and on about this girl and asking me about this and that. So he gets a clue to leave so...I eat...& Oh wow I was blown away at how good this burger is.  I don't know if I have angered the God's this week or what but Boy with girl issues comes back and gives a ticket I'm like look I want apple pie and my husband wants a orange shake so he opens the ticket back up and bring us the sweet stuff and I'm like ooooo! Its got a tooth pick in my apple pie a la mode that's different. Now skippie gave me a fork I was like it's dessert love I need a spoon. I had enough of that boy to be honest with you. I hurry up and ate and ran to the car. The food is extra good I will return for take out Lord knows I cant eat inside with hover boy all at my table with his million of problems I feel like my food should have been free. He needs a therapist all his problems sound like personal problems and I'm not trying to be mean but I just wanted dinner just a great burger with my husband. I swear this town seems to be bad at dinner. I can never have dinner with my husband in a peaceful manner. That's it I am gonna learn to cook at home. Eating out is driving me nuts eather they cant cook the food or they cant leave the table. Tonight I'm having steak and I'm cooking it at home myself.  My husband kept his receipt our server his name was Andre we sat at table 32\1 our total was $38.35 almost 40 bucks for a dinner that was great but failed because Andre could not leave his personal life at home ugh!

Since it was lunch time by the time we got there, we walked just a few feet away to Johnny Rockets, located in the same strip mall.  It was my first time eating here.  If I recall correctly, we were the only customers, but our waiter was polite and efficient during the entire meal.  I ordered a Coke with the chocolate flavor shot and a tuna melt sandwich (I don't eat hamburgers).  The Coke was interesting in concept, but the chocolate was only obvious (to both my friend and I) as an aftertaste.  The tuna melt was edible but extremely small.  I also tried the onion rings/french fries combo that my friend ordered.  Both of them were decent.  On a completely different note (and to no fault of any of the employees), the 50s music started to drive me crazy about halfway through the meal.  By the end of our visit though, seeing the pretty cheap tab that I needed to pay (for the both of us) more than made up for any of the audial  dislike  I had experienced just a short while before.
