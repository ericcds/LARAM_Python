By the time his show ended we were starving so we went to HHaGG and the service was a bit slow, our server was not particularly attentive, though he seemed nice enough. It took forever to get water refills. I order the pork tenderloin sandwich, my wife got the mashed potato and bacon burger, our friend ordered the portebello sandwich and roasted red pepper burger. The food took a looooong time to come out and about 5 minutes befre we got our food we had to flag down the wait to get refills and at that point he offered to bring out bisuits for us and we accepted. The bisquits were hard and dry as hell, but the honey was good. Not one us even ate half of one. The food came out and my pork sandwich was ridiculous, the pork was the size of half the plate, it was tricky to eat as they put it on a normal sized bun, for some reason the top bun was soft but the bottom bun was a rock. The mashed potato burger was great, and the balsamic vinigerette dressing was nice on the side salad. No one really LOVED their food so it was all right. We had a restaurant.com coupon so we had to spend $35. We ordered a cheesecake to go, it was m&m cheesecake, it was awesome.

I have been meaning to try this chain, but I was to lazy to venture out of my Henderson bubble... and now I don't have to!!   Well, obviously (if you have heard of Hash House A Go Go) the portions are incredibly HUGE.... So whether you're sharing or hung over, one plate is PLENTY. I love the location of this place because it is in the M Casino, and the restaurant  has a beautiful window that allows you to see the entire Vegas valley.   We opted to not share, and tried our own things...I got the #2 Scramble (which they say is made with 2 eggs... maybe 2 ostrich eggs) and it had ham, spinach, and cheddar. Boring, yes I know... but DELICIOUSS. Along with this, it had a biscuit and some potatoes, country style is what I will call them? Did I come near to finishing this food even though I was trying not to waste?? NOPE... I ate at about 2pm and it is now 7:30pm and I am STILL stuffed.   My friend got the famous chicken and waffles and it was absolutely beautiful. It was a man's version of waffles as what I would like to think of it. Bacon is placed into the waffles and they are baked fresh to order... the sage fried chicken was very flavorful and moist too! He didn't finish his dish either:[  My one complaint was the service. It wasn't bad... it was just odd. Our waitress seemed like she was slamming our drinks and plates down on our table... maybe she was too tall??? And our time spent with her was short and pressured.   Oh well, that is something easily fixed... and I have no complaints about the food.

We were warned that they were short staffed but nothing much we could do.  This place is located inside the M Resort and Casino. Being that it is inside the casino, parking is everywhere. The view while sitting in the restaurant has a very peaceful mountain view. Ask to sit near the windows.  We were seated by a very polite hostess that was extremely busy! She took our drink order and bussed our table too. Our server came and took our food order but the food took awhile to get to us.  We ordered the bacon/avocado burger, chicken and waffles, fried salmon burger and an omelet. All of which we would rank as just ok tasting. My burger was overdone but they were so backed up and busy, we didn't see our server for awhile so I just ate it. I definitely would not order a burger here again.

I'm mostly basing my rating off of service because I think it really reflects the type of experience you have.  I have to say I think the food here is overrated and this place is based off of hype. Their chicken and waffles didn't blow me away, neither did the crispy salmon sandwich, nor the Snickers pancake. We also tried the  HH Famous Smore Mocha,  I would've been fine not trying it. There wasn't anything spectacular for a $6.95 mocha drink. I think I paid for presentation.   I have a voucher only valid for dinner so I'll probably return just to use that.  ********* UPDATE ********* I went back and compared to the first time, I may have just went there on a really busy weekend. The second time around we had an awesome server named John. He was very enthusiastic about all the food HH has to offer and made the experience much more enjoyable. The complimentary biscuits they give you at dinner filled me up before the meal even came. Again, food was average for me, probably because big portions don't really excite me.

The one thing that irks me the most about a dining establishment is service. I understand that the M is a busy place these days and Hash House is a popular place, but service is important to me.

Somehow, the bartender who is suppose to be making drinks for all the tables and the bar was our waiter. He was funny, but he was barely there. The waiters that were all around us were on top of their tables it seemed like, but not one stopped to come get our drinks after 10 minutes of sitting there. Not until he came. Which he ended up making this awful watermelon something that he swore by. It looked nice, but tasted awful. That is just me though. It took us forever to put our drink orders in and our food orders in. It also took forever to get the check, pay, and get it back.

The potatoes were overcooked that they were very brown, too hard on the outside and dry. I like to be able to taste the softness in potatoes, but you hardly could with these. The chunks of their award-winning meatloaf were also bland, and the biscuit was overdone that the outside was like an armor coating.

M resort is a beautiful hotel but that's about where it ends.  Hash house is the type of restaurant where its either your thing food wise or it isn't. So I don't want to ding them too much there. If you love gigantic gaudy portions of food with tons of stuff on the plate you will love the food here. If you like a more simple refined breakfast with a few good flavors and a nice cup of coffee (like me) then you will probably dislike it. Once you sift through what's on your plate you can actually find some good flavors and tastes. So that part is what it is.  What really hurts the restaurant almost universally is the service. In a word, just terrible. From the front hostess to the servers. They are just not on their game and seem less than interested in being there. They could be more friendly, more professional, more organized.   I went on a Friday morning for breakfast.  At the front the hostess informed me I should sit in the bar because service would be less slow than the main dining room. I wanted to sit in the brighter dining room. I think that was where it went downhill. I waited maybe 10 minutes before finally flagging someone down to actually get me a coffee. That was bad.   Then I noticed with my seat right by the kitchen I could hear frequent shouting between employees. I used to run a restaurant and I would never allow my team to scream and shout, playful banter or not, within customer ear shot. Terribly unprofessional.

If I had known how big the portions were before I came, I wouldn't have bothered buying the coupon.  Hash House is located in the M Hotel.  Nice place, both of them.  Waited 5 minutes for a table on a Saturday night.  The service was the hang up.  Our waitress was nice, but she was the only one I saw in the place, servicing a dozen tables and bringing out plates the size of hubcaps.  Seriously.  We ordered Fried Green Tomatoes to start  4 slices, each about an inch thick, with goat cheese and balsamic syrup.  I wanted it to be good, but it was just ok.  Something was missing, like flavor, maybe?  The garnish was a thick slice of watermelon, and that was my favorite thing about the dish.  For entrées we ordered the crab cakes and the Pounded Pork tenderloin.  Again, if I'd known about the portion sizes, we would have split a salad and an entrée, but ce la vie.  My plate was 20 inches of thinly sliced, fried something covered in brownish-red gravy, sitting atop a mountain of fried mashed potatoes.  It looked completely unappetizing.  I'm not sure what the meat was, probably pork, but it WASN'T tenderloin.  I took one bite and couldn't eat any more.  Under the meat/gravy combo were some really nice mashed potatoes with roasted tomatoes and caramelized onions, but I had to peel back a scab of fried cheese to even get to them.  The whole meal was a turn-off.  The crab cakes, however, were thick and light, drizzled with a nice red-pepper roumelade and served with some yummy roasted squash and green beans.  It was a solid 3.5 star dish, especially for the size/price.  We finished with a completely unremarkable bread pudding for dessert.  The whole meal came to about $70, and could easily have been about half that if not for the stupid coupon.  Totally my bad.  I would like to try the place again and order more approprietly.

It was about 15 minutes from the time out first item came out to the last. Waiting for everyone's food to come out before starting was terrible. With my sweet French toast they stuck a huge sprig of rosemary in it... Weird. I do understand that is just what they do but weird. The service was horrible! My drinks were empty almost the entire time.   The second time we went I ordered a BLT. It was not good. The bacon was under cooked and very fatty. The tomatoes were green and crunchy and I'm pretty sure frozen at one time. They put half of a head of wedge lettuce on it. The bread was soggy from all of the butter on it. I had to disassemble it to make it so I could actually eat it... Not a good start. As I was taking off 90% of the lettuce I noticed there was no mayo. Who eats a BLT with no mayo!? Seriously? So I waited until the server came back. I ordered fries with my sandwich because I heard they were good. Well some person in the kitchen decided that it would be a good idea to put cooked bell pepper on top... Nothing on the menu said that there would be bell pepper on my fries! Well my order came last (17+ minutes after the first order came) so I waited to send my fries back and order mayo. I waited and waited. Literally waited until everyone had almost finished half of their meal. The guy didn't come back! So I started to eat the fries that weren't touching the peppers. I didn't get to eat my sandwich until everyone was finished and he came to take plates away. He didn't come once to ask how our meal was. He didn't come to ask if our meal came out correctly.

It is toward the back side of the casino where the red cup cafe used to be. It was not too busy for a Sunday morning and were seated right away near the windows overlooking the pool.   I ordered the meatloaf house hash. It was served on a cast-iron skillet with biscuit, fruit & eggs. The hash itself was potatoes topped with cubed pieces of meatloaf, spinach, peppers & moz cheese.  The meatloaf itself was tasty and it was just waaaay too much food for one person. Yay, I love taking home leftovers and making a second meal of it! The bf got the hash house quesadilla which was tortillas stuffed with potatoes, eggs and other little tidbits. The bf really enjoyed it but I found it just too heavy.. he ended up taking half of it home as well.  Seems like a lot of the previous reviews had complaints with service. I found service to be fine.

I was not ready yet, because I was still trying to find something that wouldn't give me a heart attack, but those bacon waffles kept taunting me. I am a sucker for salty and sweet.   In the end I ordered the bacon, swiss, and avocado scramble with crispy potatoes. I will not lie, everything on my plate was decent, just not spectacular. The scramble itself was fluffy with cheese oozing out. The bacon gave it a little saltiness from the otherwise bland combination. The avocado was sparse compared to the generous helping of everything else on the plate. The potatoes were my favorite part. Usually I can do without all the extra carbs, but these were fried crispy with the center not being dried out which was then tossed with some diced red onions.

Every dish could probably feed 2 - 3 people, and a lot of their entrees are hit and miss. Chicken and Broccoli hash? Yuck.   Meatloaf... skip it. They like to toss these deep fried angle hair pasta sticks on every plate as garnishes, don't eat em.  This Hash House took over for the former M Cafe and thus has a very sleek and modern look to it. You can tell that this location used to be something else as the decor, and style of the Hash House doesn't really match their other locations.

I'm not hating, I appreciate it in fact. I've eating at the Sahara location several times so figured I'd give the one located inside the M a shot. If you haven't been here, you need to experience it at least once. Their portion sizes are no joke!  First off, we went there the Thursday before New Year's Eve. Originally we were going to the buffet but the line was insane - over a 2 hour wait for the buffet so I walked over to the Hash House and we were able to be sitted within 15 mins. The hostess sat us on a table overlooking the M pool. Incredible views north and west of us. The only comment I would make about the interior and atmosphere is that it was to dim for me to even read the menu. Also of the meals ordered, the burger took the longest for it to come out, had to wait 10 mins after everyone else got their food. For god sake, it's a burger!!!  Ok so we all wanted to try something different so we ordered a couple dishes - mushroom/swiss stuffed burger, fried chicken sandwich, chicken pot pie and roasted pork tenderloin hash skillet. Yeah they weren't the best meals to order but the constant raving about the chicken pot pie from the waitress, I will review the dish along with the hash skillet.   BTW - The maple buttered biscuits are awesome! I wish they would just put that maple butter in a syrup container so I can pour it all over my soft biscuits!  The chicken pot pie comes in a huge toasted foaccia cracker looking hat. I mean when you order pot pie you expect that flaky crust not a hard toasted cracker shell. Overall I was quite disappointed in the chicken pot pie, it was carbalicious but it wasn't the usual comfort food we all enjoy. I would take out the mashed potatoes and polenta. They absorbed all the gravy and left it dry. I would also go back, add more veggies and a flaky crust inside of the cracker shell. I wanted a KFC pot pie instead.  The pork tenderloin hash skillet wasn't too bad. The pork along with the crunchy hash gave the skillet a nice taste which was balanced with red peppers, potatoes and scrambled eggs. Personally I prefer a sunnyside up egg on my hash but eh you can be pleased by everyone.  A chicken sandwich is the same everywhere you go. I will comment on the burger. Huge burger, great meat quality but no flavor. Even with the ingredients on the burger, the meat had no taste to it. What a shame!  Overall I do like Hash House. As far as the M location, great location & views, service wasn't bad. I wouldn't recommend these dishes as much.

The wait was nonexistent as we came on Friday mid afternoon, but expect a wait for Sunday Brunch. The decor is farmhouse meets fancy pants. We were seated overlooking the pool with a great view of the Valley just past. The server was very friendly and was nice enough to joke and play with my 3 yr old niece. For drinks, myself and one cousin ordered Pabst Blue Ribbon which were served in the can with a chilled glass. My other cousin, not one for spirits, ordered the Iced Pistachio Mocha. Wonderfully nutty, with a tasty espresso base. We ordered an Apple juice for the little one and were stoked to see a regular sized drink (in a plastic, covered, strawed cup) (none of that asshole-ish 4 bucks for a shot BS) and it was Simply Apple! For the food, we decided to get a Farmer's Daughter combo for the babe. The pancake was the size of her head! It also came with a side of eggs and sausage. The eggs are the one thing I didn't like. Something they put in them didn't sit well with my tastebuds. The sausage was grand. Two links that had a crisp skin, soft center and a faint lavender taste that surprised all of us. For the big kids we decided to split two plates among us as the portions are giant! We ordered the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles and the Meatloaf Hash. The chicken and waffles came in the form of a giant tower of awesome! Four fresh waffles topped with two deep fried chicken breasts and a huge stalk of sage rising proudly from the center, capping the dish off at about 18 inches tall. The chicken was moist and juicy with a flavorful thin breading. The waffles had bacon cooked right into the center of them, that helped translate the sweet waffles and syrup to the savory chicken easily. It was topped with fried leeks, which also had great flavor. (try them). The Meatloaf Hash came in a giant skillet, with eggs, seasonal fruit and a hearty biscuit. The hash itself had fried potatoes, spinach and a medley of bell peppers, perfectly sweated and covered in ooey gooey cheese.  The meatloaf itself had that perfect day old taste you'd expect for use in a hash. Phenomenal!!!! The biscuit was a classic recipe, nothing too special, but each table has a small jar of preserves. These may be seasonal, but the spread du jour was a mix of peach and apricot. There was no label on it, you could literally taste both of those fruits distinctly. If all of this wasn't enough, the presentation was astounding. Every few moments another giant fortress of food would emerge from the kitchen.

The best part about this plate was the biscuit and the amazing strawberry jam. That had to be my favorite part of the whole meal.   So, in conclusion. Try it out. But, heaping amounts of  meh  food that leaves you so full that you can't eat all day is just not worth it.

I have had both breakfast and lunch and have tried everything from the tractor tire sized pancakes to the vegetable risotto. One of the things I find off putting about this restaurant is the OVER abundance of food. USUALLY, I love large portions but, this food generally has sauces and butter which doesn't generally do well the next day, so you feel like you have to eat AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE (ok, maybe thats just me and thats why my pants don't fit right now) but- I hate leaving SO MUCH FOOD!  Anyways..... Heres the ones that stick out the most-  Risotto: The flavors didn't mesh well and was more of a random mix of vegetables on top of a giant squashed which was burnt on the bottom. I ate a bit, took the box home and the butter had congealed- not the best. Andy's Sage Fried chicken: I REALLY wanted to love this dish! It sounded SO GOOD fried chicken w/ fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs- Pefect right? wrong.... The Chipotle cream is slopped on  by the bucket full and is super over powering! Its also another dish that doesn't hold up the next day...  Pancakes and Eggs: Good pancakes!

I was in the middle of house sitting and babysitting my puppy and was located by the M resort, so I tried to coordinate brunch with my friends.  I've never been to a Hash House before and thought this would have been the best opportunity to  hit two birds with one stone.   It gave me the opportunity to reconnect with friends and try a new place for my Yelp reviews.    The first thing that gave me a sign that this place was going to be good was the long wait.  First off, there was a 10 minute wait to get a buzzer.  Then it was an hour wait after wards.  WOW.  We were about to leave to go somewhere else.  I'm glad we stayed.  The outside of the restaurant had a giant size menu so we could figure out what we were going to get.  There was a bar area to the right and a waiting area to the right where the hostess stand was.  In the middle were three big barrel tower stands and a car looking statue.  The tables were metal tops with small vases of grains in it.  The tag line I saw was  twisted far rm food,  which makes sense that the decor farmers chic mixed with a modern twist.  What I really liked was the floor to ceiling windows which offered very dramatic views of the entire valley.  I really enjoyed that part of breakfast.    For my meal, I got the Man vs. Food favorite, Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict for $15.95.  This meal was HUGE!!!  They even stuck a steak knife in the middle to prevent the entire dish from falling over.  Where do I begin...hmmm...well, let's start from the bottom!  The dish was on a bed of creamy mashed potatoes.  On top of that was a light and airy, flaky biscuit.  On top of the biscuit was fresh spinach leaves, sliced tomatoes, smokey bacon, a huge cut of sage breaded fried chicken breast and topped with grilled mozzarella cheese.  The entire dish is heavily drizzled with a spicy chipotle cream sauce with chopped peppers and tomatoes.  Garnished with a pineapple and orange slice.  The chicken was definitely the star of the show for me.  Super juicy and super flavorful.  The chipotle cream sauce really enhanced the flavor of the entire dish and I loved that the tomatoes and spinach really livened up the dish with freshness.  I LOVED THIS DISH!  It will definitely keep me coming back.  I also got to try a friend's meatloaf hash and another friend's brown sugar banana pancakes which were both delicious as well.    When you come to this place, you better expect a long wait, especially on Sunday brunch.  Please stick around, you won't be disappointed!  This place really delivered it for my first visit.

Yes, I have good reason, don't worry, I'll get to it.  I still think this HHAGG at The M is the best in the valley. The ambiance is lovely and the view is great. Our waitress, although seeming a bit tired, was helpful and happy to get us our food via our coupon I bought through Travelzoo.  My Travelzoo coupon included: 2 entrees (up to $14.95), 2 drinks, alcoholic included, and a pancake appetizer. My mother and I ordered the Blueberry Pecan Pancake. It came out and well, it was bigger than my face. Yes of course, everything here is huge, but somehow it never fails to surprise me when it comes out. The pancake was very good. I loved the crunchy pecan versus blueberries cooked directly into the pancake itself.  Next is our meals: I ordered the Hammered Pork Loin Benny. My Mom got the  Man vs Food  Sage Fried Chicken Benny. We both though our mashed potatoes were quite cool when we received the dishes and we picked around them to eat everything else. I personally thought my pork loin was quite bland, and yes I realize it is  hammered , but it was like a flat sheet. I found it hard to cut and I was not a fan of what they used to bread it with.  Lastly, my mother needed to get change for a $20 so we could leave a tip. When she went up front to see if she could exchange the $20 for smaller bills, the flippant bus boy directed her to the casino change machine. Well I can understand if you don't give out change, but to rudely direct a customer to the casino floor without any general niceties it just rude.  So my rating falls for HHAGG. Will I try again?

You can still order burgers and a couple signature breakfast entrees, but mainly, dinner gives way to steaks, pastas, swordfish, ribs, etc.        - Portions - Their portions are large in the carb area. You get a giant helping of mash with a lot of their dinner entrees.        - Carbs - This place is a carb counter's nightmare from the giant pancakes for lunch, down to the giant complementary honey biscuits they bring out during dinner.        - View - If you sit next to the windows, you get a very nice view of the M pools. In the setting sun however, it may get a bit warm as the view faces west.        - Service - Though the staff is nice, they are very slow and at times, neglectful. Without waiving down our passing waiter, it's practically impossible to get refills. With two at the table, our entrees came to the table 5 minutes apart. **Ordered**        - $26.95 - 18 oz Bone-In Ribeye -  A very juicy steak. The maple sage garlic butter adds a subtle sweetness to the otherwise salty dish. The sauce also leaks down onto the mashed potatoes to add extra flavor to it. The melted brie cheese was also a nice touch. It went well with the bites of meat (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/T8-8C1C7QwxzZcMGK_8H4A?select=vJDEXlCwsUvWJFytn77JwQ#vJDEXlCwsUvWJFytn77JwQ).        - $23.95 - Chili Crusted Indiana Maple Leaf Farm Duck Breasts - My only complaint was you only get two medium sized breasts. They dark meat was very moist and the maple glaze added a sweet flavor that completed the dish (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/T8-8C1C7QwxzZcMGK_8H4A?select=TeEB8yZllX5iA5__W9GnPA#TeEB8yZllX5iA5__W9GnPA). **Recommendations**        - I would recommend this place for the food.

My one son ordered the snickers pancake and it was gigantic and tasty, but it's basically candy... and how can you go wrong with candy?  My other son ordered lunch fare, picking the salmon sandwich which looked crispy & amazing- he said it tasted great.  I ordered the oatmeal on my second visit and realized it was equivalent to three regular portion sizes, it was served with lots of fresh fruit and a large, sliced banana.  The cream and brown sugar that accompanied it were mismatched because they were normal size and not nearly enough to cover the geography.

The pie part is shaped kinda like a straw hat. The first time I had it, the whole thing was like super crunchy.  The 2nd time I had it, it was crunchy on the outside rim, but softish on the middle.

Unfortunately at the time (circa Fall 2010), the chicken seemed a little dry.  Other people with later reviews have stated that it was better, so probably worth trusting their reviews if they've improved  House smoked salmon hash: pretty good.  It actually seemed to be one of their smaller dishes.  Roasted chicken, garlic, onions, etc. hash: yea, this was pretty good too.  This time the chicken was fairly tender.  The Kokomo: Let me just say that this one terrifying sandwich.  It's a huge slab of some meat/sausage loaf on two texas toast with melted cheese and sundried tomato that's been soaked and sliced.  Absolutely delicious  Mashed potatoes with bacon and cheddar: It's basically mashed potatoes with bacon and grilled cheddar on top.  It's not mixed in, like I thought it would be.  A bit of advice: if you go with some people, figure out if you want to split  or not.  If you do, you won't have to take home leftovers.  They do charge 2.50 to split a plate, so order some side that you wanna eat that's cheap (or you can take home to reheat), and they'll waive the 2.50 split plate charge.

My gf & I were en route to Vegas w/ reservations @ South Point. When we heard that the M resort had opened up a Hash House location inside, we just had to hit that since it was on the way.   Luckily we got there around noon because the line tripled by the time our pagers went off for us to return & be seated. Wait wasn't too long to get in, we must have waited a half hr.   I wish we would have eaten @ the original Hash House a Go Go in San Diego, CA. Because that way we would've had a better grasp on what they were all about.   The set up inside looked more on the M side versus the Hash House theme in my opinion. Like I said, I've never been to the original location, but I had a feeling their set up would be completely different. It just felt like we were in another hotel restaurant. Nothing really jumped out & screamed  personality .  Our server did an ok job. The wait for our mango iced teas took a while, but they were definately tasty. I had their  Bacon Waffles  in mind the whole time we were driving to Vegas. Even the M resort staff member @ the club registration counter hyped up their food to us. If she goes ga-ga for Hash House, so would we right?   Our food hits the table & the portions were generous, 2 can share 1 dish. Presentation was awesome. We couldn't wait to dive in. My bacon waffles looked very promising. I cut it up, & take my 1st bite... To my surprise it was bland! The waffle itself was fluffy, had the right texture but had no flavor. The bacon inside it was either on the health conscious side, or had no seasoning what so ever. I was dissapointed.   I felt like I was eating @ a senior citizens center because the food just completely lacked flavor. I would have been more satisfied eating @ a hole in the wall breakfast spot that used grease, w/ a chef that had a heavy hand with salt.   I forgot what Diane had ordered, but it was your simple eggs, toast, bacon, & potatoes breakfast. She wasn't too happy w/ her meal either. The bacon on her plate was bland also. Eggs were cooked right but not impressive. The potatoes she had were rock hard! The server even told us it took a while because the potatos prior were too burnt, so he gave us this new dish instead. Didn't look like it made much of a difference. We had tapped one of the potatoes on the plate & yeah, it was definately harder than a satisfied Viagra consumer.   We asked the server if we can just get comped for the potatoes because we weren't happy. They did offer us mashed potatoes, but we were already done w/ our meals, we just wanted to leave. They gladly comped us for the potatoes. Luckily their prices are about the same as a Denny's, if not cheaper. So our total only came out to $20. It was ok food.  This experience made us really want to try out the original.

They have three locations locally (and a 4th in San Diego).  You can eat at the famous location off Sahara, their location at Imperial palace, or at this location at the M hotel.  This location probably has the shortest wait of the three Hash House locations, but the drawback is that it's a few miles outside of the strip.  What makes this place stand out is the sheer quantity of food that you get.  You'll notice that immediately if you people watch and you look at the dishes at others' tables.

I had a meal with some friends that were locals in Vegas and they talked about how they've shared meals between 2-3 people.  You definitely get your money's worth here.  I ordered their house hash with chorizo, jalapeno, and cheddar.  It's served with their crispy potatoes and two eggs, which I had cooked over-medium.   Their chorizo is made with pork and beef and it was pretty tasty.  I ordered their watermelon kiwi lemonade to go with my breakfast and it was very refreshing.  My friend ordered their Tractor Driver combo with their french toast.  It comes with two eggs and bacon and their french toast was a favorite amongst my group. It's served with a lightly caramelized banana and a nice pecan maple syrup.  My local friends attest that their sage chicken + waffles w/ bacon and their chicken pot pies are awesome for future visits.  They definitely have some creativity in the menu, you get a lot of food for what you pay (the dishes are definitely sharable), and you have plenty of options for food/drink.

Place was dead, and we got our check by 11pm and it was under $50.  I ended up ordering Andy's Crispy Sage Fried Chicken Salad. Yeah it's a $15 salad but it will definitely fill you up! It was simple but full of tons of flavors. The Blue cheese had just the right amount of flavor and the chicken was lightly fired and tender on the inside. Don't forget the hint of sage! The pecans were caramelized and sweet and definitely complimented the green apples. (I hope this is making you hungry, my mouth was salivating as I wrote this!) The biscuit was warm for a while and crispy, it wasn't bad I just wasn't a fan.   The only drawbacks I could say were the small service failures. We ordered a burger without tomatoes and got them anyways, and also ordered waters with lemon but didn't get those either. You'd think the bartender would be able to cut a few slices; after all he did take our orders! It didn't particularly bother me; it's just a pet peeve...  Overall it wasn't a bad experience. This place deserves 4/5 but the small service failures knocked it down to a 3 for me. However I would definitely return if I was visiting the M Resort again.  Food portions were definitely 5/5, food quality was 4/5, service was 2/5 and the ambience was 3/5. The only thing I could have done without would have been the WWF playing on our TV screen; it just didn't fit in with the ambience of the restaurant.

Well, after an over night flight and settling into our car, we decided that breakfast was in order and we would require a large portion of food or the ability to order multiple dishes. Well, a friend recommended going to Hash House a Go Go and since we were already south at the airport, we opted to head on down to their location at the M Resort...While the portions were certainly large and the prices reasonable, the food ultimately fell flat.  The menu is certainly wide ranging and the breakfast menu comes across with some appetizing delights. With eggs, scrambles, pancakes, benedicts and more you are sure to find an item that will please the palate and fill your stomach. That being said, the roasted chicken house hash which was one of their popular items fell flat. The chicken was a tad dry and came across as leftover rotisserie chicken from Safeway tossed with peppers, asparagus and rosemary and then left on top of potatoes. It could have used a tad more salt and just a bit more flavor. The original benedict was interesting however the red pepper cream needed a bit more flavor and the bacon was a bit on the skimpy side. The banana brown sugar flapjack was ok but also didn't have an even banana flavor that would have been pleasant to have. All in all, the verdict ultimately bottoms down to the fact that the flavors missed the mark and could have used some salt. Maybe not the iced-tea which was quite lovely.  Service was ok and the staff generally attentive. The water in my glass did go empty once but they were by from time to time to check in on us and make sure we were ok and comfortable. The ambiance was certainly light and airy and was the one highlight of the experience. Tables were well spaced so that you wouldn't be taking part into your neighbors conversation while the seating was pleasant to the bum so you could enjoy the company you were with.

Which way will my 3.5-star experience tip?  After two bad experiences at HHaGG - the first being a disgustingly greasy meal at the Imperial Palace location, and the second being a weird situation at this location that would be a review unto itself (short version: social networking liaisons sometimes lie, and we didn't bother staying long enough to order food) - I really didn't think I'd give this Hash House a chance.  But, husbands who've had good experiences here with friends can be persuasive, so on Christmas Eve morning we came in for brunch.  It's still a bit boggling to me that vegetarians pretty much *have* to visit HHaGG during breakfast/brunch. The dinner menu only offers a mushroom sandwich. The morning menus offer that, or a feta/spinach/egg dish, or the quesadilla. It may be a great mushroom sandwich, but really? That's it? In a  Twisted Farm Food -themed restaurant the best HHaGG can do is a single sandwich on the dinner menu? No egg concoctions, no waffles, nothing? (And again, it's not like these options are plentiful on the breakfast menu, either. Bizarre.)  Oh well, here I was at brunch specifically to try the quesadilla, which was advertised as being filled with potatoes, eggs, cheese, and chiles, served with a chile (as in pepper) cream sauce on top, and placed on a bed of mashed potatoes. Intriguing.  But first I had to try the Kiwi Strawberry Lemonade. It was refreshing and perfectly balanced between sweet and sour (and so pretty, at least until you stir up the three sections), although at $4.95, I'd probably be just as happy next time with paying a little less for strawberry lemonade and being able to get refills for $1 each.  Our food arrived and, per the Hash House motif, my  quesadilla  was about as long as from my fingertips to my inside elbow. Golly!   I can't believe that entire dish is only $12.95,  said my husband, who thinks this kind of value should nudge me toward four stars. True, you could easily make three still-ample servings from this single quesadilla.  But... sorry honey... I have to go with three stars.  Yes, the service was very good (this time). The booths were comfortable. The view is still as clear and nice as it was when this was the Red Cup Cafe, TVs aside. The value, as stated, is great (assuming you don't go nuts with the special beverages), and I understand that  farm food  implies a heaviness to the meal, so I shouldn't take off points for that. Furthermore, I'd recommend this Hash House to anyone (well, anyone who isn't a vegetarian), just because the concept is fun and the chain does have so many fans.  But the taste? To me? Not so amazing. Once the novelty of size and interpretation wore off, the execution left me feeling like flavor is not what Hash House is bothering to build its buzz on.  If you do order the quesadilla, first be aware that the potatoes inside are going to be mashed. (You may not expect that, since only the potatoes underneath are specified as mashed.)   Next tip: eat from the middle. If you start daintily eating from one end, you'll be full before you get past the part that is best described as  mashed potatoes inside a semi-fried flour tortilla. ) All of the eggs and cheese are in the middle of the quesadilla.  Next: brace yourself that the  chile cream  on top is going to look like it came from a glass jar of store brand nacho cheese dip. And honestly? It didn't taste unlike this, either. Not bad, but not the  perfect finishing note  the waiter described it as.  Bonus tip: wipe off the hot sauce drizzle from one side of the plate with one of your extra napkins. Otherwise, you may be like me and keep putting the fork down on the plate, thus getting sauce on the fork, and thus getting sticky sauce on your hand. (Pilot error or design flaw? Debatable, I guess.)  Oh, oh, one more note on the quesadilla: You love discovering a fistful of sliced jalapenos lumped together inside your  mashed potato wrap with surprise pocket of eggs and cheese in the middle,  right? I like chiles, but I had imagined something a little more subtle than, after too many bites of bland mashed potatoes, suddenly having a mouthful of jalapeno slices once I hit the egg/cheese center.   Dicing. It's a good knife skill. And scattering - something else a chef can do with his hands.  The quesadilla wasn't a bad dish; it just wasn't what I expected, nor, even after adjusting my expectations and staying open-minded, is it something I'd eat again. Yes, it's a great value for what you get, but what you get isn't tasty enough to justify buying it in bulk.  So, the quesadillas are off the menu for me, and I dare not try the feta/egg dish because that's what I had at the Imperial Palace location, and my stomach still twists and burns at the thought. I guess that leaves me with the mushroom sandwich.  Or, it leaves me with all of the other delicious places to eat in Las Vegas instead.", "Date": "2011-12-26", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Amy", "ReviewID": "fpjRpzeI46hhHtLF_6_caA", "Overall": "3", "Content": "My friend and I hauled our tired bodies to the  M  Resort after a late night of casino-hopping on the strip.

Instead I was recommended flavored lemonade which conveniently does not come with free refills, not that any refills were every offered. The salads were at best OK.  Four croutons on a $8 Ceaser salad?  I also ordered the chicken and waffles.  Two thumbs up for presentation and proportions.  As for the food, I was not so impressed.

My wife was busy so I lugged my brother-in-law (Greg) to lunch.  Now, when I say get ready to bring your lunch pail, I mean get ready to eat some serious food.  This is hog heaven.  Oink oink oink oink oink.  Atmosphere -- well, the restaurant is located in the M (like 4 minutes from my house in Inspirada).  By the way, I really like the M... it is convenient for me, clean, nice, and classy.  The restaurant is situated on the second floor overlooking St Rose Blvd and a pool.  Funny thing, first time that I have been to a casino where NO one was at the pool.  You know, they should convert this pool area into a Water Park... With M being in financial straits, this could help them bring in more revenue flow (they would be the only Vegas Water Park that I know of)...  Okay, back to the restaurant, instead of eating inside, we asked to be seated outside.  It was a nice day.  Low 80s.  Restaurant is very classy and spacious.  4 stars..  Service -- Our waiter is named Pepe.  Good guy.  He filled our drinks, was quick and prompt, and checked up on us several times.  Could not ask for more... 4.5 solid stars.  Food-- okay.  We decided to order 2 dishes and split them.  We ordered the Sage Chicken (from Man vs Food show).  It was huge.  Think of a mini-size Mount Everest of potatoes, egg benedict, and biscuits that is topped off with a layer of mozzarella cheese and fried chicken.  And, stuck in the center was a Steak knife.  It was a pretty cool presentation (Kodak moment man).  As for the tastes, it was GOOD... However, a little too much food made it tastes  boring  after eating so much.  I give this a 3-4 star rating ... started great, but then the star gets lower.  In addition, we ordered the Kokomomo Meatloaf sandwich.  It was so so... It was the size of 2 1/2 sandwiches.  Honestly, I like the bread the most.  I did not care too much for the tomatoe paste nor meatloaf.  I thought the meatloaf was wayyyyy too salty and dry.  I must give this 2 stars.  I didn't care to finish it.  Oh yes, it did come with a side a Mac and Cheese which was good.  During this meal, we downed it with a bloody mary - okay... and strawberry lemonade.  For 2 with drinks, it cost us about 42 bucks (excluding tips).    Overall, we liked the service, atmosphere, and the sage chicken.

The restaurant itself is really nice. The decor was on point, modern and spacious. The staff was friendly and our server would stop by to fill our water even though it wasn't too empty; I love that though. The food came out pretty quick, given that they were pretty busy.  Everything on the menu looked delicious. I opted for the Crispy Cornmeal Salmon Sandwich, which was HUGE! Like seriously, I felt like the sandwich was as big as my face. As much as I wanted to like it, I would've liked more if it was more seasoned (like maybe more pepper or more of that chili-mayo stuff); I like things hot and super seasoned. I also got the Hash House side salad with the creamy cucumber dressing with corn croutons, which was cool and refreshing.  All in all, the ingredients were fresh and the portions are ridiculously big (so go hungry). I must say though, that I really wanted to like this place, like I REALLY wanted to like it.

The buffet was featuring a seafood special, which we didn't want, and Hash House had no line.  Let me tell you - This was one of the most awful experiences I have ever had. After waiting for nearly 10 minutes for a server, I requested that a vegetarian hash be served as a regular omelet. The server told me,  No, we don't let people make changes. Our chefs can't do it. . Having worked in F&B for over 15 years, I was somewhat surprised. I asked for a manager, who came over minutes later. He suggested an omelet with goat cheese, which I don't eat.  He then just stared a me blankly. I explained that truly all I wanted was a vegetarian omelet, no cheese.  He told me that he would need to charge me for each change I made. He wording was  It's going to cost you if you want to make these changes. . I told him that I didn't mind paying for what I wanted, but that I resents being made to feel punished for asking for a vegetarian meal.  He said,   It's not about punishment. But the truth is that I've worked for this company for over 10 years and when customers try to make changes, even with good intentions, they sometimes don't like what they get, and we don't feel we should have to be penalized for that.  Really!?!?  Hash House a Go Go is trying to maintain brand standards? Is it really an issue?   Ultimately, the manager said,  I'll do it for you this time, n But not in the future.

The food arrived in record time, literally minutes.  (hmmm, with food like this, how could that be?).  Parts of mine (not all) was cold.  The fried chicken was so dried out that I could not eat it.  My wife's scramble was cold, the cheese was not even melted, just grated on the top.  The biscuits that this place is notorious for were pale, half-risen and nasty.  We did not even finish our food.  I should have complained but did not want to deal with the drama.  If I were not a HHAGG fan and this were my first time, this review would have been a 1 star.

Even my husband, who isn't a fan of salads or anything else remotely healthy dug in and kept eating it.  He ordered the stuffed burger with bacon, avocado and cheddar.  He asked for no avocado, because again, it is just too healthy for him.  They cooked it at a requested medium rare and it came out very, very flavorful.  Much better than I thought it would be.

The challenge was, especially in the dimly lit bar, seeing any differentiation in the food. Covered in the sauce the potatoes, eggs, chicken, bacon, etc all look exactly the same.

The tomato slices weren't quite ripe so they were tough and lacking in any kind of tomato flavor, although the smothering of red pepper cream would've effectively killed any kind of flavor had it existed.  Speaking of the red pepper cream - it tasted like it came out of a jar and my plate was literally covered in it.  The smattering of raw spinach leaves was a pointless addition; the dish would've been just as hideous without them and it made no sense in even the concept of this plate to throw them on there untreated.  The biscuit tasted like raw white flour and baking powder though the texture was quite nice.    The only redeeming thing on the plate was the mashed potatoes, but by no means would I ever suggest a trip to this restaurant for mashed potatoes.

I suggested Hash House at the M as a good breakfast spot on their way out of town and I think I can declare our visit a success.  While I can't say I ever visit the M except to eat (seriously: they've got some good restaurants), the resort itself is really beautiful. Like, in the running with City Center in decor, just, ya know, farther away. Hash House is tucked into a corner, so it can be a bit hard to find, but it's worth the search. And the wait, as there probably will be one. One neat thing, however, is that they will text you when your table is ready, so you don't have to glue yourself to their benches while you wait.  If it's not already clear from the other reviews, the portions here are enormous. Like, not big: actually enormous. Two or three people could easily share one pancake. Seriously. That huge.  Frankly, though, the prices are so good that you may as well get your own entree, then take home the rest and eat off of it for a week, like Homer Simpson when he got that giant sandwich that Marge had to eventually throw away, but he went and ate it out of the trash can because it was still that good.  Last time, I got the sage fried chicken and waffles, which was quite good, but I'm not a huge sage fan. So, this time, I switched it out and got the pork benedict. Mother of god, so good. The sauce is amazing. The pork is great. The biscuit? Epic. The eggs? Great. Did I mention the sauce?  Someone in our party this time got the Snickers pancake.  What's it got in it?  she asked, thinking it was going to be like, splashes of caramel and chocolate.  Actual chopped up Snickers,  replied the waiter. . . and he did not lie. That enormous pancake must have had an entire candy bar chunked up in there.  I got a tangerine mimosa, which was fantastic. My only regret is not getting a pineapple mimosa, as that was apparently an option I somehow missed. My friend got a BLT Bloody Mary and her life has basically been changed, a la Homer's Giant Sandwich.  One thing that maybe hasn't been mentioned is that this place has a fantastic view-- panoramic, floor to ceiling windows with gorgeous views of the mountains and the Strip.

What an amazing platter worth of everything that I love about breakfast. I chose a divide and conquer method when attacking the platter and sure enough took down the entire thing but left a ravaged disaster zone worth of little scraps behind.   My deduction of three stars is based on the service side of things. Once we were seated it took about fifteen minutes to have anyone acknowledge us and come to take our drink order. Another good while for our drinks to be brought out and considerably longer before we could wave someone down to take our actual order which was almost an hour after we were initially seated. We saw our waitress only when she came to take our drink order and pick up the bill other than that our plates were brought out by additional staff and we had to wave someone down and ask for our bill. No refills throughout the meal from our waitress or any other staff was probably the hardest part when trying to take down something the size of that platter. Whatever the reason, I simply can't understand how a restaurant located in somewhere as nice as the M Resort can end up allowing this type of service to ever take place. Thanks, but no thanks.

We figured we'd kill 2 trips with 1 visit so we decided to make the 8 mile drive.  This particular location is on the casino level tucked away in a corner on the opposite side from the self-parking entrance door.  Albeit it's a trek, but good things come to those who wait.  Since the restaurant is situated in a corner, 2 walls are floor to ceiling glass and offers views of the mountains.  Thankfully they serve breakfast until 1100, and as we had a late night (this is Vegas afterall) we didn't arrive at the restaurant till 1030.  We were seated right away and the server was very prompt in welcoming us and took our drink orders.  She was kind enough and patient to give us ample time to look through the extensive breakfast menu offerings.  There were just so many choices I couldn't make up my mind.  I finally decide to order the corned beef hash with red onions and swiss cheese, while my friend decided to order the salmon eggs benedict.  My entree also came with a biscuit, fruit, and crispy potatoes.  I did read on yelp that the portions were huge, but I guess seeing the portion sizes for myself, I still slightly gasped when the food was dropped off.  I honestly wish I had enough room in my stomach to have finished all my food because it was amazingly good!!  My friend shared the same sentiments and was very satisfied with his food and he, like myself, made the difficult choice to stop eating.  Lastly, I felt the price that we paid was very reasonable, especially since the portions sizes were more than we could handle.  My corned beef hash was $12.95, and the salmon eggs benedict was $14.95.  Please see http://www.hashhouseagogo.com for complete details on their menu, prices, and locations!

The aspect about this place I didn't care for was their customer service.  When I initially called to make reservations, I got put on hold for over 5 minutes.  I get it, they're busy, but the girl picked up the phone and snapped  I'm putting you on hold.   There was no greeting, no graciousness...what kind of phone etiquette is that?  And FYI, they don't do reservations on weekends or before dinnertime (maybe that'll save you a 5 minute wait on hold, in case you were wondering), which is what I was rather rudely informed once she finally took me off hold.  When I got there and checked in, there were about 4 staff members at the front just shootin' the breeze.  They were joking around and making fun of passersby (which was kind of appalling).  They were casually leaning up against the counters.  It honestly looked like a makeshift employee breakroom.  Considering the wait to be seated was 35 minutes, I don't know why these folks didn't have something better to do.

It seemed a bit crowded when we arrived (Sunday early afternoon) and was told the wait would be 45min. They handed me the vibrating sensor which alerted me when our table was ready. I killed time by gambling a bit at the slots. The wait seemed a lot less than 45min considering I only played $3 worth.  TRACTOR COMBO - It comes with a flapjack ($1 extra for their famous ones), eggs and choice of bacon, sausage, or potatoes. I decided to pay $1 extra for the BROWN SUGAR BANANA flapjack and I'm very glad that I did. The flapjack was HUGE. I kid you not, it's like 2-3x bigger than my face! And, my face is pretty round. It was so big, the portion of the eggs and bacon looked like it didn't even belong on the plate! Perfect to eat without syrup, but it's also delicious with syrup. I love the brown sugar and huge banana slices throughout the flapjack. If you have leftovers, I suggest eating it asap because the banana does turn brown/black.  BISCUITS AND GRAVY - My bf ordered this and it was yummy! It had biscuits laying on top of a bed of red-skinned mashed potatoes smothered in white gravy mixed with sausages. I LOVE POTATOES and this dish definitely hit my carb spot! This was an awesome comfort food type dish!!!  CINNAMON ROLL A-GO-GO - When I first saw this on the menu, I got really excited. In my mind, I envisioned this to be like ... a Cinnabon in coffee form. Sadly, the hype created in my mind was not fulfilled. This drink tasted NOTHING like a cinnamon roll. I barely tasted a slight hint of cinnamon. Honestly, I think they burned the coffee because it was not the business. I thought it was my tongue and selective/picky taste buds, but my bf also confirmed that the coffee was burned. He called the drink a   BURNT A-NO-NO.  LOL. I would have asked for a new one, but I ordered mine to-go. I'm willing to give it another try. Although, ~$6 for a cup of coffee doesn't seem like a great deal. Pretty pricey actually.  PRICING - Some people consider the price pretty high here, but if you look at the size/portions, I think it's definitely worth it!

She said that the portions were huge and she was not fooling around! The portions are enormous! Here's what we ordered (I took a bite from every one):  1. HH Famous Meatloaf, roasted red peppers, fresh spinach and smoked mozzarella ($13.95): There was plenty of meat and potatoes in this dish! The potatoes were soft, but not soggy. The meatloaf were cut into cubes and were easy to bite.    2. Corned Beef, red onions and swiss cheese ($12.95): I was expecting something else, so when I tasted it, I was disappointed. It had a sour taste to it, which I'm assuming is coming from the red onions.   3. Bacon waffle ($10.95): Heeeeeeeaven is all I can say! Who cares about the bacon!  4. Chicken & waffles ($xx.xx): I enjoyed the waffles (of course), but the chicken was dry. I loved the presentation though!

Don't judge me. That's one of the reasons why you went here anyway right? Ho ho, anyway my sis who happens to live in the area took me here for breakfast since we had nothing to do at the time. I was pretty excited to try this place when my sis told me about it. We came here on a weekday, so good thing there was no wait.   They had this offer on the table where if we checked in on twitter we got a free lemonade, and of course we did. As far as what we ordered, my sis got the corned beef hash plate, while I got the roasted chicken hash plate. We also split a brown sugar banana flapjack.   The service was pretty decent. Our waiter was able to refill our drinks when the time was right, checked in to make sure we were ok, and bring out our food in a reasonable amount of time. Well, since it wasn't busy, it should have been that way.   I got to sample my sister's and her's was pretty good. The corned beef was cooked properly and I remember it came in shredded pieces. Much easier to handle. Unfortunately I felt my roasted chicken hash was a little too dry. White/breast meat is ok to me, its just that the chicken wasn't how i hoped it would taste. Like its been cooked for a little too long. The sides and fixins were decent, and I was not able to finish my meal because the portions were so damn big. Hats off to Hash House.   As for the flapjack itself, I can eat that thing all day. It comes on this huge plate and it practically covers the entire surface. You can see the bits of banana glisten in the light and the generous amount of butter waiting for you to spread it all over the flapjack. Each and every bite was sweet. the kind that makes your jaw tingle in the right way kind of sweet. I'd give 5 stars on this thing alone if I could. As much of a carnivore as I am, I'd rather just have this when I'm there.   I'll be in Vegas twice next month.

I had the Salmon Benedict and I was unpleasantly surprised that the salmon almost appeared to be canned smoke salmon.  It was a BIG let down.

Before I knew it I ate my biscuit PLUS half of my wife's one as well.    The lady ended up getting The Kokomo Sandwich - it came with a thick hunk of meatloat, roasted tomato, and smoked mozzarella on thick Amish milk bread.  Verdict?  Very good!  A fatty sandwich indeed, when you could get your mouth around all the layers it was tasty.  The meatloaf itself was yummy and went well with the tomato and smoked mozzarella cheese.  It was even better when I added a dollop of ketchup to the sandwich.  After all, who eats meatloaf without that top ketchup/tomato sauce layer??  I ended up getting one of Andy's Twisted Stuffed Burgers.  This thing is ginormous, no doubt!  It's two patties equaling one pound, and mine was stuffed with fresh mushrooms and Swiss cheese.  God I love me some mushrooms and Swiss cheese on a burger.  So massively stuffed, it comes to the table with a knife it in just to hold it upright!  It was great, just oozing with beefy juiciness in every bite.  Thankfully that burger wasn't dry!  The fresh lettuce, tomato, and onion helped to cut into all that fatness.

I watched another server try to give the grilled cheese to another table. I asked about it and that was corrected. I again waited for the third person in our party to be served. And waited.......and waited........and waited some more. 10 minutes after we finally asked about her salad and were told that the other server had served it to the wrong table. He lied, that was the grilled cheese. The salad was served about 2 minutes later and it was the wrong salad, covered in dressing, had tomatoes and grilled chicken. When we pointed this out, the waiter again tried to lie. In the interest of trying to get the heck out of there, she went ahead and ate the salad.  It wasn't until my friend with the grilled cheese realized there was dried egg on her fork that we just couldn't take it anymore. At this point I asked for the manager. He was honest, apologetic and offered to comp our entire meal.

Hangover /hæŋovr/ (medical terminology: veisalgia): NOUN. The best time to pay a visit to Hash House A Go Go.  After an all-nighter earlier this week I rode out to the M Resort location to meet an old friend for brunch. First things first, we needed (more) alcohol. I went with the 20oz.  BLT Bloody Mary  which comes with two slices of hardwood smoked bacon, at least one slice of tomato, and a full-on slice of buttered toast jammed into the rim of the glass. The toast was easily the best part, as the bacon flavor was actually lost among the refreshing, pulpy tomato and strong presence of Belvedere vodka. I could have done with a bit more spice, but the alcohol warmth was enough to help me restore some of the verve I'd lost in the previous 24 hours of drinking.  The menu is overwhelming. Who wouldn't want a corned beef, or pork tenderloin, or chorizon and jalapeno hash served with eggs and crispy potatoes in a giant skillet? Or the sausage gravy and biscuits with eggs and mashed potatoes? I finally decided on  Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict,  which boasted fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs set atop a GIANT homemade split biscuit, which itself was nestled atop a large mound of griddled mashed potatoes. It was, to put it mildly, a huge fucking plate of food for one guy (read: me) to demolish by himself. I almost made it. If I had another hour, I would have successfully put the whole thing away. Maybe not the rosemary branch or dried pasta that skewered the dish, or the unappealing wilted spinach...but the important parts.  Service was good, if a bit awkward. I think our waiter was new, as he wasn't the best communicator, but he meant well. Also, twice during the meal alarms sounded saying there was an incident occurring inside the resort that required immediate evacuation. Not the most pleasant thing to hear while you're trying to kill your hangover with booze and grub. Other than that, it was good!

The Meatloaf was incredible as well, there are so many layers of flavor.  It takes all the things you like about meatloaf and amplified them, while removing the things you don't like.  The Meatloaf sits on two extra thick slices of buttered Texas toast.  The final addition is a thick layer of cheese on top of the meatloaf, forming a cheese skirt on the side.  I said cheese skirt, people.  This is reminiscent of the legendary Squeeze Inn in Sacramento or Napa Valley.  The Mac & Cheese, though highly recommended by the waitress (who claimed to be a M&C aficionado), was alright.  The cheese sauce was grainy, but there's the pleasant surprise of scallions in the dish.  Penne pasta replaces the traditional elbow macaroni.

The environment is lovely since it's at the M Hotel. It's busy on weekend nights, especially when the line for the Studio B Buffet is crazy long; people tend to come here for a second option. But if you come during the week or even for breakfast & lunch, it'll be pretty nice and quiet! 1) Service: Obviously, the service is amazing. The servers are so patient and attentive, and they actually have suggestions when you ask them about their favorites! It's great! 2) Food: The portions are HUGE. It's definitely a bang for your buck. My boyfriend and I are both big eaters, and we were STUFFED when we finished the entree. We even debated on taking it home for leftovers. Also, it tastes great. What more could you ask for?

We got there at 7:30pm, on a Thursday and the wait was 2-hours long but uh...the buffet closes at 9pm?  Hello, McFly?  Walked over to HH and there was a 25-minute wait but saw there was an open table at the bar, which we totally went for.  The bartender who was also our server, seemed to be the only staff member running the bar.  Ooh, not a good sign, we should've walked out.  But, he was pretty cordial, during the few times he made it out to our table.  He took our order and after 20-minutes of waiting, he finally asked one of the food runners to see if our order was up.  He apologized for the delay but never admitted any wrong doing, but I'm sure someone dropped the ball and didn't put in our order, hence an additional wait of 10-minutes.  Geez, does it really take 30-minutes to make a salad??  When our food came out, it's the total HHaGG experience; a bountiful amount of food, with sprig of sage and fried spaghetti to simulate grass.  I ordered the Corned Beef Hash which I didn't realize were julienne cut pieces of actual corned beef...but I wanted the greasy spoon kind of CBH!  It was mixed with an outrageous amount of cheese sitting on a bed of (scrambled) eggs, accompanied with grilled asparagus and fresh fruit.  The grease factor was too overwhelming for me to even finish it.  Even the s/o was saying that I was just playing with my food rather than stuffing my mouth with it.  The s/o ordered their Fried Chicken Salad, which the s/o seemed to enjoy, well, then again, you can eff up salad, now can you?  Again, our server/bartender was a nice guy, probably an awesome person to know but not an efficient bartender or server.  It was tough to get simple refills on our beves, much less, to get the check.  We've been to the HHaGG at the Imperial Palace and it was, alright.  This last visit just confirmed my distaste for HHaGG, not to mention, the dining options at the M Resort.

My part ordered the pot pie and friend chicken.   When it was delivered, ours eyes leaped at the prospect of how delicious our meal was going to be. The first bite was amazing, but I wonder if it was the way the food was presented. After a few bites, here is where the two popular items stand.   Pot Pie .. too much rosemary, and not enough flavor in the pot pie itself. I felt that the sweet potatoes and broccoli really took away from the traditional flavors that the peas and carrots gave. Similar colors, but made it very bland since the sweet potatoes didn't get any of the mixes' flavors, or lack thereof.   Fried Chicken .. the skin and chicken were under-seasoned. It probably missed a salty (season salt-esque) flavor that happened to be on the fried leeks. I can let the soft bacon waffle pass if only something on the dish was actually crunchy. The waffle itself was delicious, but because I felt the main item was the lackluster chicken ... the waffles were just wasted in the dish.   The service this day was also slow ... We had this really cheery and sweet waitress, then all of a sudden, she disappeared and we were left with some tired people.

The gentleman that helped on the phone sounded polite, he even reserved a table for us by the window. However, when we got to hash house, our reservation was no where to be found. The hostess was nice enough to help us as fast as she could so we didnt have to wait long. The restaurant is not very big, very nice though. Then again, the M resort itself was super gorgeous.  The food portions at hash house is very big for what we paid for. We ordered 3 meals and had left overs. The food was delicious! The waffles and chicken are to die for and the pancake is bigger than your face. I was very satisfied with my food, but very disappoint with our waitress/service. Throughout my experience at this restaurant, I did not see one bit of a smile on that woman's face. She looked like she hated her job. Unfortunately, we were obligated to tip her because we had a gift certificate from restaurant.com. My family and I concluded that whether she treated us well or not, she was going to get her tip. I looked at other waiters/waitresses to see if she was the only pissed off worker, but it looked like everyone working there was having the worse time of their lives.

The decor is just alot more fun and unique. Although this location has a great view of the pool, but otherwise the restaurant looks like any other.   But when it comes to food, this place always amazes me with the giant portions and not so giant price.  A friend of mine has the mango and coconut pancake. Easily a foot in diameter. Very tasty, good balance of fruit and dough.  I had the roasted chicken, corn and pepper scramble. I found that the chicken seemed like reheated chicken, wasnt too thrilled about that one, but the corn, red peppers and onions tasted pretty good with the eggs. Also came with a choice of mashed potatoes or crispy. I went with the crispy and liked them overall. Oh yeah, this also came with a slice of watermelon, cantaloupe, and a giant biscut. And no, I didnt finish it all.   The bf had the sage fried chicken benedict, the one they are famous for and I guess a Man Vs. Food favorite! Theres just so much going on with this one, I dont know where to start. A bed of mashed potatoes with 2 huge pieces of fried chicken on top, and somewhere in the middle was eggs, biscuit, tomatoes, basil, gravy, and cheese? Not sure if Im missing something in there. I thought the chicken had a nice light sage taste to it, but I was expecting it to be stronger. Overall was pretty tasty though.   We also split the breakfast quesadilla, as if we needed an appetizer. Egg, cheese, potato and jalapeno in a tortilla topped with a chipotle sauce. Very yummy with a good amount of heat to it without being too spicey.

I am a quality of quantity kind of person, so let me discuss the food.  The chicken was super juicy but a bit greasy.  The breading did not have a ton of flavor, and I had to add salt to it.  It is good that there was maple syrup to pour on there or else it would have not had any flavor at all.  The waffles were definitely better than the chicken.  Obviously, they had wonderful flavor, as there were strips of bacon running through the center of the waffles.    My waiter was friendly and provided very good service.

I started this crazy food adventure with a tiger prawn tower of excitement graced with a drizzle of spicy aioli sauce.

Along side of the steak and potatoes, there were grilled asparagus spears. The steaks were perfectly made to order of medium well. The bison flank steak was something I've only had before in a hamburger and tasted leaner in a steak form. I could only finish one of the bison flank steaks and one of the boneless ribeye steaks. There were two of each on the giant plate. Of course I had to save  room  for dessert!  My waiter highly recommended I try the special butterscotch pound cake with caramel drizzle and chocolate Snickers bread pudding. I knew I wasn't going to be able to eat all of each, but I ordered them anyway so I could take some of that home for later. The butterscotch pound cake was presented in several slices in a small dish with caramel drizzle all around. I enjoyed that the bread was moist but not overly moist like bread pudding. Then came the chocolate Snickers bread pudding. This dessert is like a crazy mix between the excellent chocolate bar with peanuts and a chocolate bread pudding. It is served hot and tasty. The waiter was excellent too, as he always made sure those drinks kept getting refilled. If you can't stand in the huge line for the buffet, try Hash House.

You cannot complain that you are NOT full after eating here! I think my husband was the only one that finished his plate.

He memorized all of it which was pretty impressive.   The only noticeable negative about our experience was that our waiter disappeared near the end. (waited 20 mins to pay the bill) We had to hunt down someone.. anyone! And the guy we flagged down said he couldn't ring up our bill and that we had to find our original server.

Arrived at 6:30 promptly for our reservation, was told it would be 10 to 15 minutes, by a host that we had to find, and appeared not happy to be there.   About 10 minutes later we were seated. Not sure why we waited because there were ample tables and it appeared that they were staffed for them. However what was worse is the party that came in behind us also had a 6:30 reservation, they were seated right next to us at 7:15pm. (I would have been long gone)  I ate at the HH on Sahara when it first opened and remembered their portions were large and warned my family. They weren't large, they were huge... one entrée could easily feed a family of four.   They brought huge homemade biscuits to the table, along with honey butter and peach preserves. So not to fill up, we took a bite of the biscuits. Very tasty and with the peaches on it, tasted like a cobbler.   I ordered the warm spinach salad. The description sounded delicious. Unfortunately it was way over dressed, to the point of dressing pooling on my plate, and the dressing had maple flavoring to it.. Not a great taste to go along with tomatoes.   I also ordered the cornmeal encrusted shrimp. Presentation was nice, 3 on a skewer stuck on top of a slice of watermelon. The watermelon was the only thing good about this dish. The shrimp were overcooked, cold and the crust was hard, the texture was light crushed shells on the beach.   Other orders at the table included the Meatloaf with mashed potatoes. Great flavor to the meatloaf and gravy. But 3 thick slices of meatloaf are literally served on top of at least a pound of mashed potatoes, along with a side of carrots and a side of green beans. Took more home, than what was eaten. This is the entrée that could feed all of my family.   We also order the blue cheese burger. 2 patties with blue cheese melted in the middle. Presentation was great. Eating just half of the burger is equivalent to one large burger. I had a bite.. Blue cheese tasted great, but the patty was well done and dry. French fries were good.   I gave 2 stars because once seated our service was great! Waiter was very helpful in suggesting items on the menu. Always had our drinks filled and very friendly.   The food was not something I would crave and want to go back. Too bad, because the restaurant has great views.", "Date": "2013-07-05", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jade", "ReviewID": "F7-v5MRIGXicZWyZAS1LJQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Wowie wow wow, Hash House A Go Go.  Thees ees beeeg phattt foood.  Not only gigantuan, but seriously tasty.  Win-win.  Can't help but love it.  Pancakes bigger than dinner platters.  Salads that use a whole head of lettuce.  Mountains of corned beef slammed onto a few pounds of huge golden crisp potato pieces.  Softball-sized buttermilk biscuits.  Amounts of jam (enough for a jam jar) being given away as take-home samples.  Brown Sugar Banana pancake.  Do NOT miss.  Super duper *Ü*ber-scrumptious.  Order and you'll see.  Chock full of banana pieces, perfectly fluffy texture, not dry at all.  Could not stop eating it; addictive and AMAAASING.  You'd never expect something so enormous would deliver on taste.  But the quality matches the quantity.  Hash House has an epic winner here.  Brown Sugar Banana-- easily my most favourite pancake in years.  Maybe ever.  Portions are outrageous-- enough to feed a famished farmhand or two-- but that's the theme here.  And everything from food to service and atmosphere was appetising, fresh, yummm-aaasing, friendly and perfect.  Totally heart Hash House at the 'M'.  I can't wait to go back to Vegas and walk their menu-- so many tasty items.  Curious to also check out the other HHs in town, see how they measure up.  So, the food?  Fantabulous.  Excuse me now, though, for this next tangent.  But I need to vent.  Getting to this Go-Go was almost a no-go because of lame freeway signage.  Oh yes, they have signs that indicate Saint Rose Parkway in x-number of miles.  What they *don't* make clear is 'you have to exit here, stupid'.  That double sign totally misleads some of us non-residents.  It *appears* to indicate St. Rose is coming up, while the right-hand part of the sign shows this exit goes to another road.  Wronggg.  Nowhere on the g!d@#$%_)* sign is there any f%^#$%^ arrow or something warning that you must also take this d%$^& exit for 'St. Rose'!!!  An extra, stupid arrow would help.  I'm not saying California doesn't have its share of sucky highway signs.  But the desolation after the missed exit, the forced waste of another 15-20 minutes and gas... PANIC on I-15.   Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrgh!  Hey, Nevada highway planners and sign makers:  why didn't you f*(&^^g DO THE RIGHT THING AND PUT AN ARROW ON THE ST.

Fill it with a little bit of butter and it's honey butter heaven.

We all had bloody marys because of their great reviews, but they were among the worst we have had in Las Vegas yet.

Went to the M Resort for the Sunday brunch buffet with some friends that were visiting. I know its weird being a food snob but they have root beer on draft and it's fun to gorge yourself once in a while with 200 different dishes at your disposal. Usually not a wait, but I guess the rave brought a lotta people this weekend and the line was a mile long. Nothing else open except for Hash House and the Deli.   I actually ran into some lady on a plane about 6 years ago on a business trip who said her friends' son owns the place and it was really great. Never been there till now. I've heard some mixed reviews, but I went in with an open mind and an empty stomach.   They were running a 30 minute wait which was no big deal. Service for the most part was adequate at best. I do not have a high opinion of this place even though they have I think 5 locations and some exposure on Food Network. Putting a lotta slop on a plate is all it takes? Definitely yes  twisted farm food . Has anyone ever seen what the pigs eat? Watch  Shaun the Sheep  if you're not sure. Food took a LONG time to come out. The worst part is that my wife's food never came out. The waitress apologized 5 times and finally comped her meal. When her dish which was mostly undercooked partially raw egg french toast came out everyone else was done eating. It came with grilled banana and the running joke was,  In 45 minutes they couldn't remove the peel and finish cooking the toast?    I'm sorry but I am not from the Midwest while I highly appreciate Southern cooking, there was nothing remotely nostalgic, tasty or appetizing about the food. One of my friends did order the  Man vs Food  special which was probably the best thing on the table. A huge piece of fried pork with some scrambled eggs and a maple sauce. The only dish slightly decent was this reinterpretation of Japanese tonkatsu. Also tried the side of biscuits and gravy. It was ok, the one at Babycakes in Summerlin is much better in comparison.   I had the Andy fried chicken which was a 4-5 oz  airline chicken breast . It didn't taste bad, but wasn't anything special. Everyone keeps referring to the GIGANTIC portions. There was this huge plate with 2 grade A SMALL eggs over easy, 2 strips of bacon, as I stated a 5 oz fried chicken breast, maybe 3 helpings of mashed potato with a super dry biscuit the size of a tennis ball and a Rosemary branch sticking out. Most of the plates were the same, supplemented with mounds of potato and smothered in thick cream sauces with big branches of garnish. YEAAAH.....I guess that's value if you can eat the plate too. DO YOU PEOPLE know that you are paying $12-$15 for mostly potato which is dirt cheap.   BTW what's the point with the dry biscuit and they don't even offer any butter? Might as well serve toast, at least it's edible. I know people that grew up on farms and I don't think they would write home about this biscuit, which made the portion size bigger but really sucked.   Also had the Pistachio Mocha. It was a basic iced coffee drink with a pistachio syrup drizzle over the whipped cream.   If you like cheap slop and long waits, by all means this is the place to go.
