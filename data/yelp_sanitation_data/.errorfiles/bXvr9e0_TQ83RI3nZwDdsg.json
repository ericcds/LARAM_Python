When you walk in there is a small dining area with showcase of Columbian things on sale and there is another bigger dining area. I ordered the Bandeja Paisa which is the Colombian traditional plate- it has Grilled steak, fried pork rind, chorizo, red beans, a Colombian sausage, fried egg with rice and your choice of fried ripe or green plantain. It was $15.99 and was ok but the portion was big. The pork rind was too crispy and hard to eat. The order took a long time and there were only two other tables. The soda from Columbia was ok. The menu was too expensive for my taste.", "Date": "2015-09-16", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Mila", "ReviewID": "da8ykaU6kgtw2zm-JuUSvg", "Overall": "4", "Content": "So here we go.  I ordered Chicharron con arepas y bandeja paisa.  Now had I known the Bandeja Paisa came with Chicharron and an arepa I would have just ordered that.  That being said those two things plus a Guava nectar were $22 which I thought was a bit pricey.  In any case - the chicharron was good.  Good amount of crunch, right amount of meat and fat left on it.  I thought it could have been seasoned a little better but they are probably just trying to tailor it to the American palette (which mine is not).  So what is the deal with Arepas?  They are just plain tasteless little corn meal patty things?  I mean I like corn meal but they are white corn meal not even yellow so not much flavor?  That being said they are soft and lovely to soak up 'other' flavors with just don't come with any flavor of their own.    Now to the Bandeja Paisa.  They should just call this a sh*t load of meat platter lol.  Cuz wow.  Came with sausage, steak (flank or skirt), chicharron, yellow plantain, arepa, rice and kidney beans (on the side), and an egg.  Now I don't know about you but when I open a food container and see a rice with an egg on top I'm pretty much thinking SUCCESS!  LOL.  So similar feeling when I saw the Bandeja Paisa.  In pieces:  Rice - perfect (no flavor but none needed as it had beans and an egg)  Sausage - started out feeling weird about it because the texture is weird it has meat chunks in it vs. ground stuff but it's SOOO flavorful and soon became my favorite part of the dish.  Beans - They were OK.  Our beans (Puerto Rican) have a lot of flavor and these were a little bland but not bad.  Steak - thin and a bit dry - could have used more flavor again but not bad at all.  Egg - over easy.    Yellow plantain - sweet and delicious - hard to mess this up  Chicarron - same as it was in the appetizer plate  Arepa - same  Overall I enjoyed it - felt stuffed and enjoyed the new food experience.  Service was fine - I called the order in to go and the guy behind the counter was pleasant enough.  On a side note - God help you if you speak Spanish from a different country other than Colombia because the girl that took my order over the phone spoke at mach speed.  LOL.  But no biggie.    Was sad I forgot to order Flan.  I am ALWAYS disappointed in Flan I get outside of my grandmother's kitchen so I will order that up next time.  UPDATE:  I later came back and ordered CHEESE arepa and it was yummy so I give them another star now that I understand the whole arepa thing.", "Date": "2012-09-06", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Julia", "ReviewID": "yG2LO-6_fOLE0m7v9XkE8Q", "Overall": "5", "Content": "We go to this little spot on Sahara and Decatur quite frequently! Ever since the day when we wanted saimin at Aloha Kitchen but by the time we got there, we had changed our minds and wanted something different? So I remember one of my friends  checking in  to Oiga Mira Vea and her caption was pretty eye catching. It said :   YUUUUUUMMMMMM ... Yeah, that's pretty much all I need to hear or see to know where I'm going for lunch! So it's small inside and there's a wooden door that slides back to reveal a restaurant/night club during late night hours! GENIUS! Also, the entire staff is family which I always love! This is definitely your typical hole-in-the-wall that serves some of the best food kind of place! Try the Cuban sandwich which is marinated pulled pork (carnitas) on a soft grilled french style bread smothered in white melted cheese, pickles and a little mayonaise.. I know, doesn't sound healthy when you write it all out, but hey, you don't go to a Colombian spot to eat healthy that's for sure! Oh yeah, if you're not a fan of oil drenched soggy fries, (which I'm not) then you might wanna skip out on eating them or getting them all together... Just stick with the sandwich! But honestly now, we all know the real gem in this place is their empanadas! I can't explain how I feel when I bite into one of the beef delicacies? By the way they have chicken and vegetarian as well for you non red meat people out there. Just make sure to ask for extra Aji sauce because that darn sauce is the closest thing to eating pure bliss! It's so simple and fresh and I love it! If you're still not full then head on over to their glass case where they hold their baked goods and try one of their freshly fried bunuelos!!! Pronounced: BOON- WELL- OHS...I think?  Anyhow, they're balls of dough that has mixes of different mild cheeses inside and then it's deep fried! A very heavy snack but it's worth a try! So just so we are all clear on this... When making your way to Oiga Mira Vea; please make sure to either 1. Wear spandex for comfort purposes. 2. Bring a designated driver because you might not fit behind the wheel after wards. Or 3. Go on a juice diet 3 days prior so you can prepare your body for the experience you're about to have here!

I can only think of a handful of times I have actually walked out of a restaurant in which I intended to eat at. Unfortunately, this was one of them. This is why:  My fiance and I bought a deal over a year ago on restaurants.com to try out this place. We were actually really excited to give Columbian food a try, but for whatever reason, hadn't gotten around to using our coupon. We finally decided to just make a plan, and go for it. We looked over the menu and were really looking forward to coming here. We were expecting a little hole in the wall, with simple but tasty food.   And maybe that is what we would have gotten on a different day. Unfortunately, the day we went, two major red flags were present.   1. When we walked in, a handful of people were sitting in the  front  room, which is basically a convenience store front with a few tables. We weren't offered a seat in this room. Rather the hostess walked us to the larger back room- where the lights were turned off. She told us they were off because they were trying to cool the restaurant down- there is no air conditioning in the building.   We arrived at 6:00 pm on a Wednesday. It didn't seem as though they were expecting customers.   2. The second we walked in, my fiance and I both instantly noticed that the entire building wreaked of sewage. The smell could not be ignored. Sorry, but if the place I'm going to eat at smells like waste, I don't have confidence in your sanitary practices.   I've never been in a restaurant that smelled, and we immediately left.

Not only was the food very tasty, The owners and service staff were so nice and happy to see that non-Columbians were enjoying their cuisine.  We were served family style and we enjoyed the following:  Empanadas with Chimichurri-Crisp, Flavorful, and a great start to our Columbian feast.  Chicken Skewers with Rice, Beans and Sweet Plantains-Love the combination of sweet and salty, so the beans and plantains complimented the juicy chicken and addicting arroz!  The Picada is seriously a Carniwhore's heaven! a plate filled with veggies, Tostones(fried green plantains) Beef, Chicharrones, an interesting vinegary tasting Columbian style sausage, and a blood sausage which had a similar taste to Filipino Dinuguan with rice and stuffed in a sausage casing.   I personally prefer the Colombian Style Arepa to the more familiar Venezuelan arepa that Viva Las Arepas serves. OMV serves it in a griddled corn cake(your choice of yellow or white corn topped with a generous piece of queso fresco. this again is a nice combo of salty and sweet. YUM!  After a some Pastel de Guayaba, we enjoyed Tres Leches and enjoyed the club like atmosphere at the same time as our dinner which made it kinda difficult to communicate with others in our party, but nonetheless fun and festive. Salsa dancing and the Karaoke stylings of Henry Churches with his rendition of  Bailamos  and  Hero  had the crowd hootin' and hollerin'!(If you're still having a brain fart on who Henry Churches is...en espanol= Enrique Iglesias).

Columbian cuisine is one I hadn't visited in my touristy state of adventure. After coming here, I'd learn something about myself I didn't expect.  Sorting my bookmarks to 'distance from me' Oiga, Mire, Vea resulted. They were open, I was hungry, they were close by. Pulling and pushing on the entrance door, it was locked - a little dark.

I browse the menu and notice it's empty in the restaurant except a couple watching sports.   Beef empanada is presented to me with a green onion sauce. I order arroz con pollo and a sprite. While waiting on my dinner I take the first bite of the beef empanada. Holy cow! Take another bite with the sauce... That's some tasty delicious combo cow! At this point the wheels in my mind are spinning and thinking why I don't have this kind of reaction to Filipino empanadas. Cuz THIS beef empanada tells me why.   The beef empanadas are filled with meat, lightly wrapped, and has a perfect texture to the dough. It's not overly doughy nor oily. With the sauce is how they always serve it. Eating their beef empanadas came with a lesson. One of the owner's daughters told me about AJI. She told me the ingredients. It's one of those sauces I smother onto everything. The sauce recipe is Googlable.  My dinner plate came out after about 15 minutes. The yellow rice was really good. Here is another culture that serves plantains with a meal. Very nice flavor. It looked as good as it all was consumed.   They're a homely people. Extremely pleasant to speak with. They introduced me to Bunuelos and Columbian soft drinks. I enjoyed this cuisine a lot. I must return to order more beef empanadas with aji. That will be the number one for me at this place.   I recommend to try them.

The entrance to the  club  part is through some doors to the side that are  guarded  by a guy in dark clothing. I put quotes around  guarded  because it's not like he was checking IDs or anything.  Anyway, the dance floor was fun. Most of us aren't much in the way of salsa dancers, but we all managed to have a good time.

What I didn't anticipate was that more than half of them are still in my makeshift folder. This evening it was either Russian or Colombian. Russian place is closed and/or relocating.  So, it'll have to be Colombian.  Last time I dined Columbian style was at Pueblito Viejo on Bird Street, Miami, FL http://www.yelp.com/biz/pueblito-viejo-no-2-miami#query:colombian%20restaurants in Miami, FL  It was like the second coming of Walt Disney. Eccentric, overwhelmingly eclectic to the max, animated and authentic Colombian from the moment I had set foot into that restaurant.  Now keep that picture in mind and strip all those Disney characters from the ceiling and walls.  That's what Oiga, Mire, Vea Colombian Cuisine is simply about.  It's all about the muy rapido speaking server, a room fit for a union hall meeting and those monster black JBL speakers suspended from the ceiling.  Fortunately, it was not time for the partying to start.  So we got to dine in peace and quiet. Yelper Kevin P's review will tell you what it's like during party time. It's the work hard and play hard factor.  Our server was quick to suggest sampling the following (talk about being lead by the nose):  Bunuelo:  round bread, fried, made from white corn flour and cheese  Empanada:  turn-over stuffed with meat and diced potatoes. Served with  Aji  homemade mild green sauce.  Bandeja Paisa:  Colombian traditional mix plate of grilled steak, fried pork rind, red beans, rice, chorizo, fried egg, in this case fried ripe plantain.  Ajiaco:  Chicken soup with Colombian yellow potatoes, domestic potatoes and corn on the cob,  Served with sour cream, capers, and rice.  As it turns out there's enough food for another meal for two.  In retrospect, the leftovers tasted even better.  To wash things down, we ordered a Colombian pina and their version of a cola soda. Our muy rapido server has now begun to call us  her babies.  She obviously took a liking to us.  We talked story about family.  She has a 37 year old son... you couldn't tell by looking at her (that's a compliment).  Once again I've tinkered with Colombian cuisine, I would very much like to taste more of this cultural mix of indigenous, Spanish, African, Arab and some Asian influences. It was much too late in the evening to try their Colombian coffee and desserts.

The fact that it turns into a great spot to salsa on weekend nights (till 5AM) is a bonus. Last night I had stopped for a nightcap @ Mario S.'s nearby bar & my friend Diana called to say  come dancing!    Food here is authentic Colombian, cooked to order and rich with depth of flavor, pride in culture and tradition: just downright feel good. They have fruit flavored shakes and sodas from Colombia. Other products adorn the front room (think smaller, Colombian Rocco's)   Either version of the plantains are addictive (patacones, or platonos maduros) the Arepas are deliciously authentic, and empanadas (including vegetarian!) are amongst the best I've had. The Bunelos look like orancini but are filled with cheese, puffy balls of love I tell ya! Basic dishes from Arroz con pollo to Ensaladas de Frutas (fruit & cheese salad served in half a pineapple) and specialties from chicken, beef, fish and sides round out the something for everyone hearty fare. Portions are plentiful and prices are very reasonable.   This is comfort food and it shows: soups include oxtail, tripe, hen and chicken, Pescado (fish) is on Friday (they have a special of the day @ 7.95 generous portions, usually include rice, salad, platanos or Arepas) Sandwich combos include fries and soda.   Do you like tripe for breakfast? Done! Though I love the Huevos Pericos con Arepa (eggs w onion tomato & mozzarella stuffed arepa) or Desayuno Paisa: (eggs w onions, tomatoes, rice & beans w a mozz arepa = hangover food) There really is a choice for any craving here. Having traveled extensively throughout South & Latin America (and Puerto Rico, DR etc) I can see why folks gravitate toward this down home spot. Once you take your first bite...you are no longer in a Strip Mall @ Sahara & Decatur!   I like to go for a late dinner on a Saturday & eat family style (UYE is coming) in the back room; walls are covered with paintings for sale by local artists. After a delicious meal, a beer or my favorite: Cristal = Colombian licorice liqueur (almost like a less syrupy Sambucca) the tables move to the side, the lights dim & Salsa rules the floor and the speakers. You can still sit at a table, order food and have water, soda or drinks, but I suggest you get up and dance the night away at one of the truly special hidden gems in town.   You can check out the full menu online. If you happen to be in the area, stop in.

When I parked, I couldn't tell if there was a seating area, it looked like a walk up/ counter.  My sister and I were just planning to order some empanadas to go, but after meeting the owner and being fed his spanish greeting and his cultural energy, we decided to sit in. We looked thru the menu, very different of course, from a Mexican menu. But I have this weakness for tamales. So we ordered a couple empanadas and one Tamal, it comes with side of lightly sweet n sticky rice. Allow me to emphasize on the aji sauce. I love celantro and lime. Therefore I love this sauce. Dont be afraid to drench your empanadas in aji or drench you aji in empanadas.   Its a family oriented little restaurant. Has that  downtown shack  feel to it, but it's no biggy to me when the food and service is on beat.  We also had some Colombian soda. Nothing special. But, we did buy some Colombian chocolate candy. Pretty nifty.   Something I did notice, sis and i were already done with dinner, and just chatting it up, when I noticed the workers putting up chairs. I realized they were closed 9 minutes ago.

Truth be told, we hesitated going in.  The outside of the restaurant is off-putting ... but hey, we're here.  Let's give it a go.  And boy, did we enjoy our dinner!  I actually jotted down and ordered other posters' recommendations.  We had sweet plantains, arepas, vegetarian empanadas, bunelos, garlic potatoes -- wow, that's a lot of garlic! --  skewers of chicken and beef, what looked like pork schnitzel.  Yum.  I particularly liked the Columbian condiment aji, a piquant mixture of cilantro and onions.  If you go to this restaurant, know that it's not fine dining.  The décor is hum drum -- perhaps even depressing -- but the food?! Real good!  And plenty of leftovers to take home.  March 2015 Update:  We were ushered into the same bleak dining room, but the music was at such a high decibel that we walked out.  Rather than turn it down,  the server  seated us in the front room which doubles as a store.  (Subsequent patrons also refused the dining room.)  The food was as good as I remembered.  My daughter's steak look nondescript, but it was loaded with flavor.  Same with my grilled chicken.  My problem -- and I didn't deduct a star for this -- was the wait.  Service was interminable, and while our waitress was awfully nice, she refused to be rushed.  (We waited forever for our check, as she chatted with another table.)  An older woman -- the owner?  the server's mom? -- knocked over my fruity Columbian drink.  About half spilled on the table.  Did she bring me another?  Did she deduct it from our bill?  No!!

I was stuffed, satisfied, entertained, and blown away with the quality of the food. The best characteristic that makes it of great quality is that it is HOMEMADE and made from scratch. There's nothing like eating your friend's mom's homemade cooking.  The empanadas? AMAZING! Sad to say that I actually like these empanadas than my country's empanadas. The crust was crunchy and soft, but not too thick where it dries your mouth and over powers the stuffing inside. PERF! It was made with a mixture of meat and potatoes. It wasn't super filling. Oh..you just had to be there.  Next dish was the chicken skewers with a side of beans and rice. What's in the rice! It's flavored rice and it was so good. I wanted to eat more of it, but I just didn't want to get sucked into the asian stereotype of hoarding rice (...ehem). The chicken was so tender and well marinated.  My favorite though was the arepa con queso (I think that's the one)...it's this tortilla topped with this nice sweet creamy cheese! It was so good, and fattening for sure, but I wanted so much more it. That will surely be one of my motivations to come back.   Second motivation, is the Picada. It's like a big plated feast for royalty! It has this DELICIOUSLY flavored grilled steak, pork rinds, sausage, this blood sausage (which everyone was raving about!), potatoes, and these awesome fried green plantains I kept picking off. Oh it was so good and the helping is good to feed a family of four!  Third motivation is the entertainment. Karaoke? Oh yes they do! Some Colombians sure have vocal chords built for the gods! They also have this cute little salsa session where you can bust out your DWTS moves on the floor. Get your ball change on! If I had the choreographic skills to keep up with the pros I probably would have busted a move on the dance floor for much longer.   Thanks so much Christie O for introducing to us this amazing place! the owners are SO SWEET and HOSPITABLE! It was as if we were their guests in their home! I felt super welcomed!

We weren't very excited when we first walked into the door since the entrance area looks like a tiny deli place.

(on the side note, the owner and the wairess here are both SUPER FRIENDLY!!)  We ordered the Empanadas and the Papas Rellenas for our appetizers.  Both the Empanadas and the Papas Rellenas are to die for!  The only thing is, that the prices shown on the meny are  per empanada  and  per Papas Rellenas.   (so your bill could come back pricey!)  For the main courses, we had the skewers and the Tamal.  The skewers were wonderfully flavored, however, a bit on the dry end.  The Tamal tasted wonderful and has a WHOLE CHICKEN LEG in it?!!!

It was easy to find, located in an eclectic strip mall far away from the main part of LV where there is plenty of parking! Walking into this family owned restaurant we were greeted with a friendly Hola! I was not expecting this as I stumbled over my own Spanish and answered her in a half hola/hello (insert embarrassment).  She said we could sit anywhere, which we picked to sit in the larger dining room/dance area. In the dining area, it is on the dim side but with the large screen TV, we could see.  The set up of their dining room/ dance area is hard to explain, I have seen it a couple of times when I would eat at Ecuadorian restaurants in LA.  Dark tables and dark chairs with high backs.  Artwork is hung on all the walls around the dining area. At one point, I kind of fell in love with the fat Jesus painting and wanted to take a photo. Mama was out in the dining room cleaning the table closest to the stage, at first I thought she was talking to someone else but then I realized she was speaking to me and in which again caught off guard I stammered and stuttered as she asked if I spoke en espanol. To which I said to her un poco. Ahhhh she said and walked away.   Our waitress brought us our menus and some churriauce to use for later. I ordered an ice tea, which was kissed with lemon and a hint of sugar. Not too bad tasting!  After looking over the menu our waitress asked if we were ready to order, in which we said yes!  Appetizers:  -Empanadas-Turn-overs stuffed with meat and diced potatoes -Chicharron- This is not your Mexican mama's chicharron that she would give you back in the days, instead this was more south america mama style which I kind of liked better- Each rind was crunchy and soft, squeeze some lime on it before you start eating it!  Each of these appetizers was single serving but just enough for two to share!  The MAIN EVENT-  Arepa with shredded meat- The meat has a lot of flavor and was not dry, but still I wanted to kick up the spice flavor and added some churriauce sauce and it brought out the taste even more!

Overall service was friendly. There seemed to be a whole family working. Food was made fresh to order and took a few minutes longer than one might usually expect to wait for an order, but the quality of the food more than justifies any delay you might experience.  The EMPANADAS with the green sauce were a great start to our meal: BF isn't typically a fan of these small meat pies, but he inhaled one and had to be warned not to eat mine as well. Acidity of the green sauce brightened up the flavor. The LENGUA IN SALSA was to die for. No kidding, the sauce of tomatoes and onions and potatoes is heavenly, the perfect south American comfort food. The lengua itself was a plentiful portion, stewed to just the right texture and doneness that it fell apart beautifully. The CHULETAS dish was also a gigantic portion, and the green sauce came in handy here as well, keeping the dish from becoming boring. Speaking of boring, most people don't consider rice to be all that exciting. The rice here is perfect: fluffy, light, warm, and flavorful, rather than just filler. I generally stay away from or go light on carbs, and this rice had me sneaking bites until it was all gone. Chuleta was served with a side salad, which came with several tomato wedges and nearly an entire lime- all very fresh! Side of YUCCA- this version was nice and crispy like very thick steak fries, but I prefer them with a stronger garlic seasoning to them. Added a bit of salt and ate with yet more of the green sauce.
