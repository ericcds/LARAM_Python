The famous pad Thai was a bit over cooked, so the noodles were mushy but the flavor was there.

OMg I will go back just for that bowl of noodle soup. You gotta make sure to season it with the extra spice on the side. It was at the very far end of the tables from the entrance.

Thai food being prepared right in front of you by the people who know it best! Plus all proceeds go to helping the monastery. It's a win for everyone!  You have to get the Pad Thai! It's only $5 for this huge serving that could probably serve 2-3 people. Remember to come early though because wait times can be loooong. There are other delicious things to choose from like BBQ peak skewers ($1 each), beef and fish ball noodle soup ($5), papaya salad ($5) and dessert roti ($1). Depending on your appetite, you can have a whole day's worth of food for $15. The infamous curry puffs are $5 for about 7 pieces, which you have to reserve a month before. They also sell vegetables for those people who like to cook!  I haven't tried everything yet, but I always look forward to this every month.

I live a mile away!! The food fair was a nice way to spend a Sunday morning. It was a great excuse to finally meet some great yelpers.  My husband was a little apprehensive at first. He made a few Hangover II jokes (you know which one) when I told him I wanted to go. But now, he's all about going next time (July 28th). I think it's because we overloaded on just a couple of items and since hindsight is 20\20, I think next time we are going to make an effort to try a bunch of little things and take advantage of the variety.  After you trade in cash for tokens, we walked up and down the line to scope out all the food. It proved a little difficult because not all food stations had signage. All you have to do is ask. What made this event for me was how friendly and helpful the ladies of the event were. They were all sweet and appreciative of everything you buy because it goes to their church.  My husband waited in line for the chicken skewers while I waited for some pad thai. The pad thai was pretty darn good for being just $5.  The chicken skewers ($10 for a box) were good too but we aren't going to get as much next time. My husband picked out these little fried cakes with dipping sauce. He really liked it....until a fellow yelper pointed out it consisted of pureed fish (he doesn't eat fish). I would pay money to see his reaction again.  From start to finish, this was a great experience. I definitely want to go back not just to support the monastery, but to try more stuff: the thai teas, the spices, spinach cakes, the soup, the tea leaf salad, and the sausage.  If you enjoy great thai food, put this little monthly food fair on your to-do list!", "Date": "2013-06-24", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Elizabeth", "ReviewID": "zdKObCzyVtNlIKxLLkiZaw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "YUMMMMY! Hubby and I went again Sunday :)  I will describe a bunch of items we bought, sorry I don't know the actual names of the foods and I would LOVE to learn!  Pad Thai! I made sure to order it right away, that way we could shop around while it was made to order. I got no egg and no chicken in mine :) it came with fresh lime, crushed peanuts, hot chili flakes and it was a HUGE portion for $5.  We had fried crispy (wonton skin) round spinach cakes. I loved the sauce that they served to dip it in (sorry I don't know what these are called). They were fresh and very hot when we bit into them. A perfect start on the freezing morning! I think it came with three cakes.  I also purchased a set of kumquat/small oranges...wow they are soooo good. The lady was soo sweet and explained that she likes to eat them when they get a little dried out :) I said I do too because they get sweeter! I also bought some coconut and mango small pancake like goodies. And also some banana leaf baked mango cupcakes with fresh coconut flakes on the top. The pancakes and cupcakes were both VERY good and were savory and not sweet.  I also got a Thai tea which was VERY sweet this time :) it was still good! I just kept adding ice to it when we got home :)  I can't wait until the next one on March 31st!", "Date": "2013-02-28", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Danielle", "ReviewID": "b5Kd45Dp5gDE3tuPxSOTuw", "Overall": "4", "Content": "This was a fun and different thing to do in Vegas. There was a surprisingly large amount of food for sale. Many of the desserts were $2 per serving, Thai iced tea was $2 and Roti was $1 each. We bought 5 limes for $1 and a large bunch of basil (I think it was $1). They also had lemongrass. Everyone working the tables were friendly and helped explain what everything was since I didn't recognize most things. Several did tell me to come earlier the next time, as many things were already gone. I do wish there had been more tables with chairs - we had to sit on a curb to eat until a table came available. I did take a quick look into the temple, which I'd never been in, and I felt very welcomed.   One tip I'll give -- the pad thai took about 30 min + after ordering (very popular! and very good), so next time I'll be putting my order in there first and then check out the rest.", "Date": "2013-10-22", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Crystalyn", "ReviewID": "fG7nYXKKu2gOt2cY7zA9fA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "This event is a must!!

But never gave this food fair a try until now.  I must say that I have missed out on some pretty good food until now.  We got there about 10:15am and there were already lots of people sitting at the tables eating already.  We first tried their soup noodle bowls and it was definitely worth the $5 price.  They do not skimp on the meat or the noodles.  You got a very decent size bowl with a broth that was quite tasty.  Next it was on to the Thai iced coffee and iced tea with some pork skewers.  The skewers were only a buck.  It was too bad the only meat they were serving was pork.  Then it was on to try their Pad Thai noodles.  This dish was definitely worth it.  You got a big portion of Pad Thai and it was delicious.  We will have to come again next month just for this one.  We ended our food fair with a sampling of the various desserts that were being made fresh in front of us.These $2 items were also worth it, but I prefer the salty dishes instead of the sweet delights.  All in all, we had a very good time sampling all the various foods.  The only little negative thing about this food fair, is the fact that the tables and chairs that were set up were not very clean.", "Date": "2013-07-29", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Melissa", "ReviewID": "wHwhSnHTAOgy8NQaZ5c5vA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "I keep seeing this on yelp and finally got a chance to go! I am glad I did. I suggest going early morning because when we went around 11:00 a.m. the sticky rice and mango and pad thai were sold out. Don't even bother going after 12:00 p.m. because the only thing left were premade desserts and other premade items.   I tried a noodle soup with fish balls I think, which was okay.  I prefer the tom yum type sour soups. I really liked the pork BBQ sticks a lot! The rice came in a ziploc bag which was really so Asian, I loved it. I also tried a rice cake which resembled Filipino puto with different colors and it was okay, pretty spongy not dense like puto. I liked the ball of not sure what it was actually but it was covered in shredded coconut. That had a subtle sweetness.  I saw roti and I normally love roti, but I wasn't sure if it came with a curry or not. Next time I will ask but it appeared to be a dessert roti possibly?  I saw larb was available but I wish there was more hot food to try. Thanks to Teri C. for letting me try the secret curry puff! It tasted sort of pumpkin like and not really curry like I was expecting. It was very tasty. I think this is a cool place to get some Thai food made by real Thai people.

It's getting pretty crowded since my first time here over 2 years ago. I sat on the landscape bricks in the sun as all the tables were taken. I didn't see the Yelp group, so either I'm blind or no one was there.   A nice tour through the back garden/reflection area, 40 minute meditation inside the temple....and then it was time to head home for some March Madness games.

The monthly fundraiser for the monks promises excellent eats for nothing. A group of us got together for Nelson's UYE and filled our bellies and had some to take home with us. Mike, Anthony, and I ended up going the family style route. We just need better communication skills. We ended up buying many of the same dishes. It goes towards a good cause and it is cheap, so no one loses.   The chicken on rice is such a simple dish, but it is amazing. The ginger sauce makes it. The skewers are moist and tender. The papaya salad carries some kick if you ask for it. The pad thai comes in a generous portion and taste better than most of the restaurants in Vegas. Finish off with the steamed sticky rice with taro will do since they will not be doing mango sticky rice until next mango season.   The weather this past month was perfect.

Have yet to try the mango sticky rice everyone's been raving about...haven't seen it at the fairs I've been to. Hoping to be able to try it next time around!  The fair is staffed by the nicest volunteers that cook up homestyle eats to help raise money for the Chaiya monastery. Just make sure to show up early, otherwise the food will be all gone!

Be forewarned, this is no huge festival or fair. Its a charity for the Chaiya Meditation Monastery, where this is hosted at. All run by volunteers from vegas as well as ones that come up monthly on a day trip, from california. If you were to describe this fair, id say it be a home cooked style.   First time around, we had arrived at 9:30, weather was still quite warm, but it was packed. We had to park around the corner, on the street. All the tables were full, so we had to sit on the side, where a short wall is built with bricks for landscape. Granted, the amount of people went down, as months passed, and weather got colder, but this time (january), the amount of people has increased again. I would suggest arriving at 9am if you would like to have a shot at all the available foods before they get sold out.   To start off, they recommend you to exchange your cash for tokens. Easier for them to be paid, and easier for you to pay them. Any amount can be exchanged, and you'll receive coins in $1, $2, and $5 increments. If you have anything left over, you are able to exchange it back for cash, or keep until next time !   Chicken Curry Puff Pastry - This is ONLY sold by pre-order. Didn't know first month, waited till 2nd month. Was told prior to 2nd visit pre-order required. Didnt get it till 3rd visit. So pre-ordering, you'll receive the product next time, and pay then as well. Each  bag  is $5 and you get about 8 pieces? give or take. They are made off-site so when you pick up your order, it will be cold. To be honest, eating them there, as is, was not too impressing. But if you take them home, re-heat them with a mini oven, they are pretty delicious. You'll make the pasty nice and crispy again, filling of the chicken, curry, and pumpkin nice and warm/hot. It's actually pretty good then. They last a while too, if you keep them sealed, so they dont dry out.   BBQ Pork & Chicken Satay. $1/skewer. The first time, the wait was really long. But as months passed, they have been getting smarter, pre-cooking a batch for the early people, so they wont get backed up too badly. The meat was cooked pretty well but seasoning, all i can say, is SWEET. Im pretty sure they marinated it at least a day or two, as well as during the grilling process, they probably coat it with honey. Also have noticed, i think these are made by Archies (the thai restaurant, have seen people with the logo on their shirt around that station).   Chicken & Rice: $5/order. Also known as Hai-nan Chicken Rice, or at least VERY similar. Your choice of either white meat or dark meat or both. Bone-less. With a side of rice that is cooked with chicken stock, and a cup of sauce made with ginger for dipping. Probably one of the lighter items they have at this fair, and not sweet as well. Saves pretty well too. Can be reheated in microwave without a problem.   Pad Thai: $5/order. COME EARLY AND ORDER. Each order, is cooked individually, so it takes some time to get through. And a lot of people order more than 1. When freshly made and eaten. Delicious ! Though the quality control on it kind of varies. The past few times, its been cooked by 1 person. A male chef. This time (january), it was cooked by two people. Though orders may be fulfilled by the same chef, but both my friend and I think, ours were fulfilled by the female chef this time. Little sour, not enough ketchup? flavor. Seem to be a little lacking on the  wok hei  or flavor from the wok =P Still pretty good nonetheless. DO TAKE NOTE, if you are buying extra orders to be eaten later in the week, when you reheat in the microwave, put it on a plate, and spread the noodles. Makes heating up much easier and faster, and it wont harden the noodles.   Pork Noodle Soup: $5/bowl. Choice of vermicelli or wide noodles. It was an interesting experience with my friend and i trying to figure out what the meat was. But, its pork. Overall, not bad. Pork meat and meatballs noodle soup. Simple as that. Last month (December), when the cali volunteers weren't here, they had a different soup. It was slightly spicy. It was delicious ! Was excellent with the weather ! But it seemed like it was a one time thing *sad face*   Sweet Roti: $1/ea. Roti with pan seared with a clump of butter and topped with sugar, and rolled up. Its so good but oh so bad. GET IT!  Great little fair. Great food, different from the normal in-restaurant style. A bit early for us night owls, but worth it. Fairly cheap for most things. Most are delicious.

The place was abuzz when we got there, you could feel the excitement in the air or maybe it was just me overjoyed at finally being there hahaha.

Seriously, I'm kicking myself for not coming sooner but no love lost as I now plan to come every month!   For $40 we were able to take home a feast.   -2 Pad Thai ($5 each), a portion easily feeds 2 people. It was very flavorful, better than most of the ones I've had in restaurants.  -8 Pork Satays (4 for $5) I was delighted at the price especially when I'm used to paying twice as much at Filipino joints. Perfect balance of savory and a little bit of sweetness. Tastes a lot like the Filipino bbq sticks I'm accustomed to minus the price tag.  -5 Sweet Roti ($1 each) This was my first time having this and easily the best bite there in my opinion! I would have gladly paid $5 each for it. It's drizzled with condensed milk and I believe fairy dust! They're oh soooo addicting!

It's done every month to pay for the mortgage of the monastery. I was told that monastery's mortgage is between 1-2 million dollars (I am estimating it). So, they have to raise a big figure  to pay the mortgage, which can't only be done on donations. The main point is that the money that is spent at the fair goes towards a good cause or at least I hope.   Food fair has the most delicious Thai food ever. The flavors in each food items range from sweet, tangy to spicy. Some of the cooks are official restaurant owners who are dedicating their time to collect the money for the previously mentioned finances. But lets go back the topic of food. Each items can run from $1-5, and you can get it packaged to take home. My favorites are as follows;  Pad Thai - Spicy-tangy noodles $5 Beef Satay - BBQ meat on a stick $1/stick Spicy fish ball soup - most flavorful soup you'll ever have $5 Curry Puffs - You have to place you order a month in advance due to popularity $5/bag  Chicken-Rice - Simple yet very flavorful. $5 Sweet Roti - Not sure if that's what its called but its rolled with sweet filling $1/roti  I bought $50 worth of food and it lasted me for  4-5 days.  If you are like me and if you are open to experience other culture. You can go inside and pray/meditate any time. The keeper of the monastery Sam is very friendly. You can also sit and chat with the monk, or just meditate in front of Budha statue.   Only negative side of things is that some of the food will take really long time to get ready since there are limited numbers of cooks and many customers. Pad Thai takes about 60-90 minutes to get ready, so place the as soon as you walk in.   Overall, I think this was the best time I had a cultural food fair.

Get started early- I got here at 8:30 and it was still pretty empty, left at 9:30 and parking was getting full, cars were pouring in. Apparently, they start as early as 7:30.  Having read tons of reviews, I got on pad Thai list right away, for 2 orders, was quoted about 20 min. I actually took longer to pick it up because I was busy stuffing my face with noodles and buying meat on a stick.   Bought a bit of everything- roti, sausage, skewers of pork, some fried dough, noodle bowls. Didn't spot the fried rice or curry pastries I've read so much about, bummer.  My daughter stalked the Popsicle people, swooped in with her dollar and got one, then was told to come get a second one for free when she was done with the first.  Bring a sturdy canvas tote, I filled mine to the brim and can't wait to sort through all the goodies.   Take your time going up and down the row of tables, everyone is friendly and happy to answer questions about the food. It's totally ok to point at everything and ask what's inside.  At the entrance, you have an option to trade your cash for tokens, but either form of payment is fine.   There are tables and chairs set up, they do fill up pretty quickly, but I got most of my food to go and didn't all that much feel like lounging in 100 degree heat.

Bullocks! I keep hearing about the curry puffs. What's the big deal?  A friend was kind enough to place an order of curry puffs for me last month. Of course, I had to go. I got to the monastery real early so I can grab my curry puffs then head to the gym. I was one of the very few that was there. The older ladies were still setting up so I was walking around. The monastery is so beautiful. It feels like a different world. Intricate gold roof designs, foo dogs by the entrance, a big gold structure in the middle...just gorgeous.  Some of the food was ready so I bought some of my Thai favorites: satay, nam prik, sticky rice with mango, fish cakes, pad Thai and spicy pork similar to chicharron. There was this lady who was giving me a whole schpill that went on and on. I had no clue what she was telling me - I don't talk Thai. I didn't want to be rude and interrupt her because she seemed like she was talking the business. A few minutes later, I politely smiled and asked her where to get my curry puffs. The older ladies running the show were so sweet and hilarious.  Oh, pretty girl ,  hey sexy, try this ,  honey, come here . But nobody seemed to know where my curry puffs were.   The food was cheap. A whole box of satay for $10. Sticky rice with mango for $6. Most stuff like crackers, cookies and rice cakes for $3/pack. Curry puffs for $5. And they're delicious!  I only had a few minutes before I had to leave. I was told I needed to find a lady with tokens to get my curry puffs. It's like a mission on  Amazing Race ! So, I asked every older lady holding old cookie tins (that's where they keep money and tokens) about my curry puffs. Finally, some lady told me  curry puff lady don't come about 9:30-10.  What?

Well, technically, my friend and I wanted to come last month but something came up and ruined our schedule so we finally got to try it this month! I must say, I likey lots!  First and foremost, this food fair isn't fancy so don't come here expecting a ton of things. They also don't have a huge variety of foods for you to choose from. It's a smaller function run by volunteers. Kind of reminds me of something like a family gathering.   Come early! My friend and I arrived at around 9:30 am and all the tables were already taken. Not to mention, there were already a lot of people there so we parked pretty far from the entrance since the parking lot was full.   There are several ways to go about beginning your trip. You can exchange your cash for tokens -- any amount. Don't worry. If you don't use up your tokens then you can exchange it back for cash. If you don't want to, I think that's fine as well because I noticed that a lot of them take cash regardless. Though the token idea makes it easier than getting cash out and stuff.   My friend and I shared most of the dishes so we got to try a majority of them on our first visit.  Stew pork noodles. $5 ...You got to choose either the rice vermicelli noodles or the flat wide rice noodles. We went with the vermicelli and we liked it. Granted, we didn't know exactly what kind of meat it came with. We figured out that the meatballs were pork balls but as for the rest of the meat, I thought it had chicken too. BUTTTT it's pork. We had fun guessing though.   Chicken and rice. $5... Awesome dish. I really really enjoyed this and even bought a 2nd serving to eat as lunch for the next day. It reminded me of Hainan Chicken ... best part? You got to choose your meat. You get the option of white, dark, or a combo of both. The rice was lightly flavored with chicken broth and eating the chicken and rice together was great. There was also a ginger sauce you could use but tbh, I don't even need it :)  BBQ Pork & Chicken Satay. $1 per skewer. The wait for this is amazingly long so when you get here early, be sure to put in your order ASAP. People order 20-30 at a time to take home. My friend and I waited half an hour for our order. They even had 3 grills going but were still backed up!! This also took me by surprise because when I think Satay, I think savory...when I took a bite of one of my skewers, it was SWEET. It was SUGARY SWEET. Holy moly  ... I'm not sure how I felt about it. I liked it but I kinda wanna just wipe the sugar off of it.   Sweet roti. $1 ... This was really yummy. They give it to you right when it's hot. It was buttery sweet goodness. I really liked it and I'm glad I had this in the morning. My body will have time to take care of all that butter! Definitely try this.   Steamed Tapioca Dumpling. $2 .. Interesting. It was a sweet and savory type of snack in the form of balls with pork filling. They give you lettuce, cilantro, and pepper with it. I'm not too much of a fan. I guess I don't particularly do well with a sweet/savory mix. I get confused.   Sweet sticky rice with taro. $1 each. This was yummy. They also had a banana version but I didn't get one .. so maybe next time. Really enjoyed it though :D I had saved this for later so by the time I ate it, it was cold :( .. I think it'd be better when it was warm.   We also tried one of their coconut jelly dessert things and their thai tea. Both were good. But everything was just really sweet to me so bring lots of water with you haha! My friend and I will DEFINITELY be back and we're going to try to bring other friends to try this as well!

I finally woke up early enough to visit this past Sunday and can say that I definitely should have listened to those who told me to go a month sooner! All proceeds go to the monastery to help pay for the mortgage. Food is delicious and very cheap!  Tables are lined up across the parking lot and you simply step up and order what each stall has to offer. On this visit I ordered pork satay skewers (4 for $5), sticky rice ($1), phad thai ($5), Lao papaya salad ($5), spring rolls (3 for $2), an assorted fried platter ($5), pork stew noodle soup ($5), and roti for dessert ($1/ roll).  The pork satay skewers are nice and tender with a slightly citrus taste that comes blends well from the char from the grill. This paired nicely with the sticky rice that came in ziplock bags. The satay skewers a staple at the food fair so I cannot wait to get my hands on some more next month! (4/5)  GET HERE EARLY TO ORDER YOUR PHAD THAI! This is one of the famous dishes of the food fair and as this only happens once a month, you can imagine how many orders are placed. After a good 30 minute wait I was finally able to taste what the hype was all about and man was it worth it. The noodles weren't mushy and overcooked. The chicken was also nice and tender. I definitely had to add some of the chili flakes that were on the side to give it a kick. Will definitely be buying more to take home next month! (4/5)  Papaya salad is made right in front of you and have the choice between Thai style or Laotian style. I went on to try the Lao style and was asked how spicy I wanted it to be between 1-10. I thought I was brave enough to go for a 6...and boy was I in for a ride. I've had too many experiences where I would order a 6 and would have to add more chillies. But this was not the case! The spice was up there but not something I couldn't handle. The green papaya is also mixed with tomatoes, and long green beans. It was a little too spicy for my family which meant it was all mine.. :) I will try the Thai style next month and will let you know how it is. Most likely delicious! (5/5)    The spring rolls were pretty average. They were stuffed with cabbage, green beans, carrots, and vermicelli noodles. They also come with a sweet chili sauce. This would be a good vegetarian option. (3/5)   The assorted fried platter included deep fried taro, bananas, doughnuts, and fried pork wontons. The doughnuts came with a condensed milk dipping sauce while the rest were accompanied with a cucumber cilantro fish sauce that tasted like the Vietnamese dipping sauce nuoc mam. The platter came with three of each. The batter of the taro and bananas were topped with black sesame seeds and had coconut in the batter which gave it a crunchy and soft texture. Doughnuts resembled the Chinese donut and tasted really good with the condensed milk. The pork wontons was very juicy inside while maintaining a nice crunchy wonton crust. (3/5)  Another crowd pleaser is the pork stew noodle soup. You can either choose a very thin rice noodle (thinner than angel hair) or a thick noodle that resembles chow fun. The noodles are topped with green onion, cilantro, and garlic followed by a scoop of pork and meatballs. Then the hot broth is poured on top and you can choose to add fish sauce and chili flakes. This was a very refreshing dish as it is starting to cool down in Vegas. This was my family's favorite dish. (4/5)  For dessert we ordered the roti which was slathered with butter, sugar, and condensed milk. I'm glad this event is only once a month as these can become very addicting especially when they are fresh off the flat top! I can't wait to have another! (4/5)  The next Chaiya Meditation Monastery monthly food fair will be Sunday, November 20th. This is definitely an event to go to! Just make sure to get up early as they only serve food from 8AM-noon. I arrived at about 9:30AM and waited 30 minutes for the phad thai.

Good crowd, a bit windy & chilly typical of January. Food prices are $1-$5 from desserts to pad thai, papaya salad Thai style (there are other versions elsewhere) pork balls noodle soup, a lot of variety of desserts & pastries. I made a beeline for thai ice tea & thai ice coffee which were $2 each, hehee. You can use cash or trade for tokens. However with tokens you will want to use them all or trade them for cash later which is a hassle to me. Got a mini cupcake for my $1 coin. Get there early as parking spots are limited. You'll end up parking on a dirt lot or walk a block away. Get a table right away since there are more people than tables/chairs, have a friend save your spots. The pad thai took us half an hour to get our order. Long line of people waiting to order, luckily we got there early. Some items will run out as people tends to buy multiple to take home.

Roti with condensed milk (we threw ours away because they were a big clump of icky mush.  If you really like this combo, you should suggest them make it and give it to you right away) $2: thai iced tea (strong and delicious) $3: sticky balls with delicious stuff inside (I am vague cause I don't know what they are called, but they were savory) $5: papaya salad (scale is from 1-10). Pad thai chicken (very good).  Fish cakes (they are a bit cold, so maybe to go this item and heat it at home).   typically the larger item in a container is about $5.

This monthly food and fundraising event has been a nice treat in the Southwest area of town. In the past couple of years, it has really gotten busy though!  Once a month, usually the last Saturday, Chaiya Mediation Monastery holds this food gathering where you can grab homemade treats for $5 or less. It starts around 9 am and lasts until 12 pm or so. But these days, they run out of the popular food items way before noon. So come early if you want your pick!  You can trade your cash for tokens but it's really unnecessary now since all the vendors take cash directly.  Among my absolute favorites are:  * Burmese Tea Salad - I love Burmese Tea Salad and I have not found one restaurant in Las Vegas that makes it. (If you know otherwise, please let me know!) The only thing is that it's not a regular item there. It's only been available a few times unfortunately. (Which makes me want it even more!)  * Mango Sticky Rice - Okay, who doesn't love this Thai dessert? Sweet rice with ripe mangoes, what's not to love? However, it's a seasonal thing and they run out fast! You need to be there early to score an order.  * Pad Thai - Made to order and a bargain for the amount you get!  * Pork Satay - Made to order and $1/stick. Put your order in and come back to get it later on. Some months it's super tender, other months it's only okay.  Other food items found:  * Hainanese Chicken and Rice * Papaya Salad (spicy!) * Curry Puffs (You need to order these a month in advance!) * Soups * Chive Pancakes * Sweet Roti Pancakes * Desserts  I was spoiled in the beginning because the Husband would head out and pick up the food while I slept in. It was a nice treat finding all these goodies waiting for me in the kitchen. But now it's a much longer wait to get your food because it's so crowded. Nonetheless, I'm glad the monastery is getting so much business and visitors. They could probably extend the amount of food vendors each month to accommodate the demand.  Side note: Cash only.

Curry Puffs (delicate and flaky texture; fluffy taste of pumpkin, puff and chicken) Egg Rolls (meh, needs more filling) Roti (sweet, sweet dough!)

After seeing EVERYBODY check in here every last Sunday of the month, I finally got the chance to join them this last one on 3/30/14. Better late than never I guess.   As I show up with my wifey, I just happen to bump into Andrew C who was nice enough to give me some pointers. He kind of ended up being my Chaiya guide along with tips by other Yelpers. First thing you notice about this place is that its right in the middle of a neighborhood community.   First stop was to put my name down on the clipboard for an order of Pad Thai ($5). Wifey got 10 Pork Satay Skewers ($1 each). Then on down to the Sticky Mango Rice table ($5). After that the Thai Soup table ($5). Next is Papaya Salad ($4).   Since just about everything was made fresh, you had to do a bit of waiting for certain things. Like the Pad Thai. They cook it from scratch with two big woks so two orders can be cooked at a time. Same goes for the Papaya Salad. The guy is literally peeling the skin off the fruit and finely slicing it for the salad mix. As for the Sticky Mango, they can only peel and cut the fruit so fast so the wait for that is based on how many mangos they can carve. Once they run out of that and sticky rice, you are out of luck. The Pork Satay Skewers are all ready to go and cooks pretty quick on the grill. The Thai Soup table has all the ingredients ready to go as well. You just need to select thick or thin noodles, then they throw it in a medium sized styrofoam bowl  along with broth, meat, and pork balls.  Shout outs go out to Nik O, Debra W, Terri R, and Chris V for helping me out also. Nik gave me her extra Eggroll to try out. Debra told me what there was to drink. Terri told me about the vegetables available for purchase. Lastly, Chris told me about the Curry Puffs that you have to order a month in advance. He even gave me one from his stash to try. Thanks a lot guys!  Some random info: Cash only! Preferrably small bills. Sometimes they give you coins that are worth 2 dollars that is valid for their items only. Come early! Show up just right before 9 am for great parking, better selection, and getting your Pad Thai quicker by being one of the first to sign up. Phone reception is low so it might take you a while to check in and upload pics sometimes. Lastly, this is an outdoor event so always be prepared for what the season may bring. If you follow what I just pointed out from beginning to end, you will fare much better than most peeps that show up later on.  Overall, I am kicking myself for not coming here sooner. Next time I am bringing back up. Usually on Saturdays and Sundays, I tend to sleep in but in cases like access to delicious cheap food and good company, I don't mind sacrificing a little bit of sleep.

There's one price you pay to get in which is $28.00, but not to worry, that's just for tokens to pay the vendors.  What you don't use they refund to you.    I was really looking for my Yelp friends to help me through this culinary adventure, but alas, I had to do this one by myself.  So I just wandered through the stalls and asked what the foods were.  So, this review is going to be minus the technical definitions and names for the foods.   I first tried the soup at the end. It resembled a Pho soup with noodles, cilantro, pork and fish balls in beef broth, I think.  That was pretty good.  Then I got two pork skewers, that was quickly devoured.  I also got some kind of dumpling that was cooked on a cloth mesh and steamed with a meat filling inside.  I did ask what I was eating, it was chicken, vegetables, peanuts, etc. etc.  I posted some pictures of the lady making it for me.  It was quite good and I know I will get that again next time.  I also got a dessert that was sort of like a heavy pancake with something like butter and sugar inside and folded over.  I made quick work of that one, too.  I enjoyed trying a lot of foods that are completely new to me.  Everyone was really friendly.  Afterwards, I took a little tour of the monastery, talked with a monk, walked the meditation garden and even went inside the temple for a bit.  I had three glasses of the herbal tea, that was so refreshing!  Next time, I will try to get the names of what I was eating so you will know what to get.

This is more like half of a $ on the Yelp scale!  And there's so much great food!  As I'm a first-timer, I have to give a huge shout-out to Anthony M. for announcing his two unclaimed curry puff bags on Yelp. I was super grateful because they must be reserved one fair in advance, which translates to one whole month. They're a treat with curry sweet potato baked in a puff pastry, and they're even better when you take them home and pop them in the oven (advice from Andrew C., I believe). It's just $5 a bag for seven pieces, which is a great deal.  I also really enjoyed the BBQ pork satay skewers. Not only are they a steal at $1, but they're very balanced in terms of sweetness and spice. Well worth the 20+ minute wait at peak times for a batch of however many you feel like ordering.  The roti are another $1 treat, and they're sweet, not savory. You'll see them preparing roti in hot oil at the table, but they actually wrap them in foil and fill up a box, meaning that there's practically no wait time. Eat them while they're hot because they won't be nearly as soft if you take them home or something.  There's also some kind of noodle soup that I can't really put a name to, but it has pork and a reasonably hot stock. It was the first taste that I had and it was a welcome treat on a very windy morning. I wouldn't call this one a deal at all, but it's worth a try.  The chicken pad thai is a pretty generous portion as well for $5, and it comes with plenty of bean sprouts and scallions. It's less greasy than any restaurant pad thai I've had, and it's still pretty tasty although it may have lacked a bit in fish sauce and sweetness. It's another really popular item with a wait, and we were lucky that we arrived before 9am or else it would've been a huge chore wading through the list.  I also got to try some items from friends. The egg rolls are definitely hot and crunchy, although they're the predominantly veggie variety, not something with pork and crab as I would have just loved. I also had a bit of mango sticky rice, which was fresh, sweet, and texturally blessed with that crunchy topping.  The som tum (green papaya salad) wasn't anything to write home about. I like the tomatoes, but the flavors are too muted overall, even without adding the fresh cabbage. It needs to be supplemented, and that's what I did with the crunchy dried shrimp and fish mix that's a worthy sweet, salty, and spicy snack on its own. The spicy number of 3 was definitely on the higher end of 3's as far as I'm concerned.  Some of the other items worth trying: the fish cakes, the fermented lemongrass pork sausage, and the fish with red curry paste and collard greens. I also enjoyed these flat, sweet dessert items with corn embedded. There's blue (taro) and green (umm, something?) varieties, and they're both sweet and reasonably chewy. The food fair at Chaiya is a monthly must if you have any appreciation of good food whatsoever. I will definitely return when I can.", "Date": "2014-03-30", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Norm", "ReviewID": "UoUZJwgi4hEf8NY9l4HKuQ", "Overall": "4", "Content": "I had the day to do what I wanted and this was a place I had to see.  I've been missing it each month so today was the day!  Parking was easy in their lot.  I first took some photos of the monastery and grounds.  It's an interesting place.  Then it was on to the food.  Everything is written in the Thai language so you need to ask what things are.  First things first--when you arrive at the food area, there's a very pleasant woman who takes your regular currency and gives you Thai coins.  I gave her $10 and she gave me a 5 Thai coin, 3 ones, and a 2 coin.  I had the five left over so I'm halfway to paying for my order for next month of the curry pumpkin pastries.  I walked down the line looking at all the wonderful foods for sale.  I was looking more for something light that would be a breakfast replacement, in a manner, and I found it where they were making roti--a type of crèpe found in many cultures.  They were not making them from scratch--rather the roti were removed from a bag and placed on the griddle to brown.  After browning, they spread some sweetened condensed milk on the roti and then some confectioners' sugar.  A wholesome breakfast if I ever heard of one.  I also bought a container of sesame balls filled with taro for dessert tonight.  I also got a container of purple rice that comes with a side of coconut milk.  This is a sweet too!  You see why I was here, don't you.  As I was looking for a place to sit, I heard my name and saw Anthony M motioning me to come join their area.  There were a couple of Yelp people there and it was nice to sit in the winter sun and enjoy my roti.  Anthony explained about ordering pad Thai quickly when you arrive because there's a wait list for getting the dish it's so popular.  Another time.  Anthony also let me try one of the coveted curry pumpkin pastries.  It was excellent!  You have to order them a month in advance!  I ordered two bags as I was leaving and I'll forgo bike riding that Sunday so I can come here at 9 AM when they open and claim my goodies.  This is a great place to go.

Sure, why not!? This crazy city never ceases to amaze me.   . Went on Sunday 1-31-16.  There is a tiny street on Rainbow between Robindale and Windmill called Santoli Ave. and that is the best way to get there.  It is right in the middle of housing subdivisions.  The monastery is quite beautiful and I wish we could have seen the inside of it.   . There is no fee for parking and there is plenty of room in a dirt lot outside the gate.  There is a pretty big curb to drive over so if you have a car that is really low to the ground you might have to park on the street and walk a long ways.  . There was no admission fee and you just walk right up and get in one of the lines.  We started at the end and worked our way to the entrance.  We had pho, egg rolls, donuts, cupcakes, pad thai, and pork skewers and spent less than $30.  They also had fresh vegetables, confectioneries, and various pastries for sale.   . The food was delicious but believe me when I tell you this place is CHAOS.  There is no signs on anything so you just hop in a line and pray it is something good.  Workers/volunteers were frazzled and downright unfriendly because they were so overwhelmed.  It think the word is getting out about this event and there are just too many people for them to handle.   . We stood in the donuts line for 45 minutes and when we finally got to the front we stood there for another 30 minutes or so while they made donuts for Thai people who kept walking up to the side of us.  I didn't say anything because I don't speak Thai so for all I know they might have been waiting longer than us or had called ahead.  My husband was ready to leave but I was like DAMMIT WE'VE BEEN STANDING HERE FOR AN HOUR AND WE ARE GOING TO EAT SOME DONUTS!  I think if they would just cut an order down to five instead of ten it wouldn't take so long to get them.  They were good but they weren't  wait an hour good  if that makes sense.   . It was really cool to see the monastery and to sample the delicious foods and I'm sure it went to a good cause but it's a one and done for me.

We started off with ordering 3 orders of pad thai at $5 each. All 3 was made by different chefs and tasted totally different.  One more flavorful than the other and one out of 3 had no meat/chicken in it. I've tasted way better pad thai and rather pay more elsewhere for better tasting pad thai.   We then went down the aisle by buying some meat skewers at $10 for 8 which was ok tasting and ended up the only edible food.   We ordered one order of papaya salad  thai style for $5.  The order came out pretty small, tasted stale and didn't soak up any juice cause it was that old.  The flavor wasn't good and not spicy at all.  We ordered the spice level of 8 from the scale of 1-10, 10 being the spiciest.  We bought the banana sticky rice and taro sticky rice.  I still haven't tried the taro but the banana wasn't good. The rice was under cooked, it was raw and no flavor at all. It's supposed to be semi sweet with a hint of coconut flavor which it lacked. $1 each so not bad. If only it was good :(  The egg rolls. I have to say was horrible. It didn't have any meat in there, it was fipped with mixed junk. That's how bad it was, I can't even tell you what's in there cause you can't even tell/taste if it was actually food in the egg roll. $2 for 3  We went for most of the desserts which was $2-5 each and didn't find one kind we liked.   The thai iced tea was $2 each but too sweet.   The hainam chicken and rice was a rip off. They gave us a box of rice and a few pieces of scrap chicken, It wasn't even clean cut pieces. $5 for a box of mostly rice and a few chicken is pretty expensive.  You'd think how'd they go wrong making this. Well there was nothing special about the chicken and rice, especially when you pay $5 for a box of mostly rice.   Lastly we went to the beef noodle soup vendor. They were $5 a bowl which was reasonable.  We ordered 2 bowls but after seeing them pour broth into the 1st bowl, we decided to cancel the second bowl. The soup base smells like intestine and urine. Eww! Sorry but we had to pass...  My overall experience was pretty bad. We spent alot of money here and didn't get anything decent enough to eat.  Either we are very picky eaters or people who go here have very low standard.  What a waste of at least $40 there.

And by heart, I mean stomach.  This is basically a small little food fair held in the parking lot of the monastery where all the funds raised goes towards the monastery itself. FYI, the lovely vendors here donate their time, money, and resources! They keep absolutely none of the profit.  The food selection is not that vast, but what they do have is always ace. In addition to food, they have home-grown herbs and vegetables, desserts, and Thai snacks.  Here's a rundown of the items I typically get: - Moo Ping/Pork Skewers: 4 for $5, grilled, juicy, and sweet, get it with the sticky rice ($1)! - Pad Thai: $5, probably the most popular item, generous portion, cooked to order so may take some time, there is a sign-up sheet - Clear Pork Noodle Soup: $5, light, choice of thin or thick noodles, condiments on the side - Thai Tea or Thai Coffee: $1, too sweet for me - Ba Tan Ko/Chinese Donuts: 50 cents a piece, dip in condensed milk, childhood favorite :) - Roti: $1, filled with condensed milk and cooked with sugar until crispy - Saku Sai Moo: 3 for $1, tapioca dumplings filled with pork, soft and tender, ask for veggies and fresh chili! - The rice noodle dumpling next to the tapioca dumplings: 3 for $1, super soft, kind of oily  Other notable items are sticky rice with pork, sticky rice with mango, coconut milk dessert, and naam (fermented pork sausage).  My main gripe is that seating can be difficult to find because word has gotten out about this little gem. This year is the busiest I have ever seen! Great for business, but not so much for those looking to eat on the premises. However, you can always share a table with some friendly folks.

I got to the food fair around 9:20 AM, taking the tip to come early.  The fair runs until 12:30 PM (not 2 like some reports) - this may be a recent change.  After greeting the check-in table with Sawadee-Ka, I paid for $15 in tokens initially.  The first booth I saw was for La Phet Toke, Burmese pickled tea leaf salad - I was SO excited!!  Teri C. would understand!  I only had this once in Buffalo, NY last summer when Eric R. found a Burmese restaurant on yelp there.  I actually have been interested in re-creating this at home but one cannot find pickled tea leaves in Vegas.  The lady at this booth said this was her first time selling it at the fair because her friends encouraged her - she pickles her own tea leaves at home and happened to have an abundance at this time.  She was happy to see me so excited and she gave me a generous portion of Thai bird chillies for it - with rice it was $4.  Next, I came across a farmers market table with kaffir lime leaves, kumquats, lemongrass, and Thai eggplants.  A bag of lime leaves is $1!!!!!  I keep them in my freezer and they last forever.  That is a steal!  Then I got fish cake for $3, which came with a dipping sauce (fish, curry paste and long bean made into cakes) - very spicy and delicious.  With my remaining $7, I got Thai iced tea for $2 and chicken pad Thai for $5.  I stopped to eat at a covered table - trying the pad Thai (enough for 3 people I think!) and devouring the fish cake.  I decided to save the tea leaf salad and remaining pad Thai for later, and went to get $6 more in tokens to buy mango-sticky rice.  In the end, I spent $21 and now have pad Thai for lunch tomorrow, Burmese tea leaf salad and rice for lunch, and mango sticky rice for dessert today and tomorrow?

It's the valley's best kept (not so secret) and you'll reget not coming sooner!   This popular Thai food fair happens on the last Sunday of every month. They're a non-profit organization selling delicious, cheap and authentic Thai food, dessert, unique produce and snacks prepared fresh on-site. Your purchases are the funds that keep their monastery running. We love supporting this cause! The ladies volunteering the event are on top of their game and very eager to sell you all of their tasty eats. Most of them travel here from Los Angeles, so you know they are dedicated! We come every month without a second thought. Keep in mind they are getting busier and busier as the word spreads, so of course the earlier you arrive, the better. The event starts at 9 AM, but I've seen overzealous fair fans show up at 8 AM. If you wish to dine there, they accommodate you with covered seating under car-ports with fold out tables and chairs, or you can take your goodies to-go.  The menu changes unpredictably and seasonally, so don't come expecting certain dishes - however, come and enjoy the in-season offerings; we always find something delicious! Make sure you come prepared with cash, it's inexpensive and for under $40 you can leave with a great selection of goodies and even set yourself up with food for the upcoming week! That's what we always do! Our lunch for the week is convenient and delicious. I love it!  They sell an assortment of Thai and Laotian goodies ranging from $1-$6, but I will mention the ones I've had the pleasure of tasting:   - Mango Sticky Rice $6 (Seasonal) Rated: 5/5  - Chicken Pad Thai ($5 a box) - there's a long wait for this as it's the most popular dish here. I suggest putting your name down on the waiting list at this station right when you get here to secure your order(s) Rated: 5/5  - Pork Satay Skewers ($5 for 4 skewers) - Very flavorful! Sweet, salty and tender pork grilled on skewers. I enjoy pairing these with the sweet roti! Sounds weird, but I love the sweet & salty combination! Rated: 5/5  - Sakoo Sai Moo ($1 for 3) - Chewy tapioca dumplings filled with savory meat & mushroom and topped with fried garlic bits. I love eating these fresh, on-site, since they are delicate and tend to get hard if you try storing them in the fridge. Rated: 5/5  - Fried Meat Dumplings - Looks like wontons or gyoza, filled with savory meat and then fried into golden brown. Simple and nice, oily snack! Rated: 3/5  - Fried Shrimp Chips - They look like fried discs made with baby dried shrimp. You can see the eyes, so maybe not for the faint of heart. Rated: 3/5  - Thai Ice Coffee and Thai Ice Tea ($2 each) - A little watered down and maybe not my favorite version, but it's nice to know it's offered here if you feel the need. Rated: 3/5  - Sweet Roti with condensed milk and sugar ($1 each) - These are ridiculously tasty! It's unfortunate for the person trying to watch their diet. But hey, it's once a month type of splurge so we always get it! They toast them up right in front of you with country crock butter and then top it with condensed milk and sugar which is then caramelized to golden brown. My only gripe, they are actually store bought roti, but a delicious brand at that! Rated: 5/5  - Taro & Banana sticky rice - Traditional little wrapped treats in banana leaf. The sticky rice is moist and the filling is tasty! Rated: 4/5  - Pork and meatball spicy and sour noodle soup/ you can ask for it non spicy ($5 each) - Another popular item that seems to always be present. It's cooked on site, served piping hot with a soothing broth, and makes a wonderful warming breakfast! Rated: 4/5  - Thai or Lao style papaya salad ($5 each) -Traditional, with different spice levels and not overpowered with sugar like you typically find at a restaurant. Rated: 3/5  - Fried doughnuts with condensed milk (Similar to  Youtiao  also known as the Chinese cruller and also the Vietnamese version  Banh Quay ) Rated: 3/5  - Curry puffs ($5 for 7 small puffs) Taro or Chicken curry with kabocha squash pumpkin curry. These are amazing and very popular! You need to place an order for these a month in advance (Call the monastery to pace you order) Rated: 5/5  - Veggie eggrolls ($2 for 3) Classic cabbage/ carrot eggrolls, maybe a little too simple and plain for me. Rated: 2/5  - Fresh Produce: Okra, Lemongrass, Thai Basil, Kaffir Lime Leaves, Thai-bird chilies & other unique produce. Rated: 5/5  Don't be overwhelmed and embrace the culture and local flavor this monthly food festival has to offer!

David V. was kind enough to let me snack on one from his batch and I was sold immediately after the first bite.

Curry Mushrooms: $5.  This we took home.  Three kinds of mushrooms and curry...HOLY SPICY BATMAN!  So delicious!  It was wrapped in a banana leaf to steam when it was heated up.

What I despise more than anything is unauthentic Asian eats. Americanized Asian food is a no go for me. It would be like ordering a gyro and instead of using feta cheese, they put American slices on it.  That would be a sin right?   But hands down, this fair is authentic and as good as it gets. It's Thai and Laos food, the way Thai and Lao people would eat. Growing up my mom and all her friends, would sit at the table with lots of food, their feet in their chairs, eating all their food with hands and spoons only, talking in their language and I am sure gossiping about all their other friends that were not there. If this place was not open to the public, I could see it like this. Just good, honest home cooked food.   The food is more than superb. It is fresh, appealing, flavorable and  just heavenly. The portions are more than suffice and definitely worth every penny. I always have leftovers.  I haven't had everything here because the options are always vast. There is just no way you could eat everything they have to offer in one visit.   But my friends, you cannot go wrong with choosing from their satay sticks, pad Thai, soup, spinach cakes, dumplings, fish cakes, sweet rotis, fruits, jellies, sum tom, drinks and much more.   My visits to the fair is somewhere in the time range of 10:30 am. Plenty of food and lots of options.   If you are coming with the family and/or friends, bring money. Plenty of it. Trust me on this. You will see something else you want and wish you had more cash on you. Items range from $1-$5.   If you want good eats, then this is the place to be.

The roti was yummy and reminded me of tortillas and butter, and the deserts were also light and delicious. My son was in love with the satay!

My go-to's are the following: pad thai (holy bleep is it good and for only $5..........are you kidding me????!!!!!)  Mango sticky rice for $6! I'll take 2 please!!! The portions are generous and delicious!  Satay - $5 for 3 sticks. Totally a bargain and super delish with a price to rival any food truck.  The sticky rice - sticky rice with banana and sticky rice with taro. I personally loved the taro and would eat enough of these to turn my butt diabetic. Omg I love these sinfully delicious treats so much and love how long they last in the fridge (4 days) is the longest they lasted until I killed them off.

We had been to a similar temple food fair in the SFV, so we had high hopes for some authentic, delicious and unpretentious Thai food.   As you first turn onto Virtue Ct, you will briefly pass through a small residential area before arriving at the Monastery. You will see fair goers parking by the side of the road, but no need. The Monastery has a very large parking lot. There is a covered outdoor area where the vendors are located, and just a few feet away there is  covered seating where one can sit down and eat. Half the fun is chatting with others at the communal tables. We met many people there for the first time, people that had been there a couple of times before such as ourselves, as well as parishioners from Thailand, Burma as well as from Tibet.  The food is absolutely delicious. It is all good, much of it great. Pad Thai, skewered meats, fish cakes, noodled soups, dessert rotis as well as dessert dumplings. So many things to try. You know you're a foodie when your table is covered in empty plates. It happens at restaurants, and it happened here as well.   If you are new to Thai food, or new to street food, and have a sense of adventure to try new things, go ahead and stop by.

I'm beating myself up for not finding this food fair sooner...I mean it is literally two blocks from my church.  I decided today would be the day, I'd swing by right before 9am and scoop up the goodies before heading to church.  As I arrive, there is ample parking in the monastery lot or on the street.  There is a lady at the front who has change for larger bills or they can also give you tokens to use at the booths.  This is also where you place an order for the curry chicken puff pastries.  I promptly put my name on the list for next month.  You cannot buy these on the spot...they are that popular.  Quick tip to avoid lines and get in and out quickly, arrive at 8:45am  So here's a quick breakdown of what I saw and the prices:  Pork satay/skewers 4 for $5  Chicken and rice (like Hainan chicken) $5 Mango sticky rice with coconut cream and toasted mung bean $6 Beef/pork noodle soup $5 Fried shrimp fritters $1 each Fried pork/taro wonton $1 for 3 Chicken pad Thai $5 Sweet roti $1 Thai drinks $2  There were also assorted produce, fish cake, sausages, desserts, cookies, rice cake looking items.  Hands down my favorites were the chicken and rice which essentially comes with a crack sauce...since it's that addicting! The shrimp fritters and pork/taro wontons, again with another sauce equally addicting.  The mango is soooo sweet, these little Thai ladies must have spidey sense when it comes to picking mangos...this is a must get item.  The noodle soup was also a tasty treat while I sat in the cold and waited for my pad Thai order.  Yes, there is a large intestine in the big vat of soup, this might scare the non-ethnic folks, but this just made me think this is gonna have some legit flavors.  The pad Thai was definitely not the best but you get value for a big container for $5....not sure if it is worth the 30 minute wait.  Skewers are a nice salty sweet treat, thinking about buying a bunch and freezing them for quick meals for the month :).

Once a month, the Chaiya Meditation Monastery hosts the fair and I finally got a chance to go with some other Yeeps.  A non-profit event, the proceeds of this event go towards paying the mortgage on the monastery, so you can eat and do good simultaneously.  Per instructions of seasoned Chaiya food fair customers, Nelson Q. and Debra W., I arrived at 9:00am.  The smell of barbeque could be detected as I drove into the parking lot.  I thought I was early, but there were already customers leaving with their plastic bags of food.   There were the food vendors on one side of the parking lot lined up and facing them were tables and chairs for the customers.  I found the papaya salad lady first, placed my order, found the Pad Thai lady, placed an order with her, and then got some pork satay sticks.  Walking along the row, I checked out the dessert lady and picked out a custard flan w/ sticky rice dessert.  WHAT I BOUGHT: Chicken Pad Thai ($5):  you should find this lady first and place your order.  She'll give you your number and then yell it out when your order is ready.  There is only chicken pad thai available, not beef, shrimp, or pork.  The orders stack up quickly, so if you are taking your order to go, you should get your name in ASAP.  Pork Satay sticks: ($1 each):  Very tasty and there are lots of sticks being barbequed on the grills.  You can also get sticky rice to go with the satay, $1 per bag.  Papaya Salad ($5):  This will be made according to your preferred spice level.  I went with zero since I don't like spicy food.  This was my least favorite of what I ordered; it had a very fishy aftertaste.  But, I'm allergic to fish, so maybe it was fish sauce?  Nevertheless, just not my fave.  Curry Puff pastries ($5 per bag):  Probably the best thing at the food fair and the hardest to get because customers must order a month in advance.  Thanks to Michael K. and Nelson Q., I got two pastries from them; the puffs are delicious, made of curried chicken and pumpkin inside of a flaky crust!    Custard over sticky rice dessert ($2):  I basically inhaled this--so good!!!  The next food fair is December 22nd. There was a steady stream of customers, so I must have been the last to know about this gem of an event.  It was great to meet some Yelpers in person, including Nik O., who shared her desserts, and socialize more with others (Nelson, Sylvia, Anthony, Debbie, Debra, Stephanie, Michael).

We would go back and forth, hopping from one vendor to another until our cravings are satisfied.   This morning, we got there around 9:30 am coming straight from church service( my mom's visiting so hearing mass is a first above all else on a Sunday morning). As soon as we drive through the gates to the temple, we saw lines of about ten deep in front of each of the vendors!  I went straight for the pad thai and put in my order. Got in third page half way down! I asked how long is the wait, was told about 45 minutes. Went next for the bbq and ordered. I was surprised, there never was a line for this in the past! My order was listed just about half way the second page and wait time was about 30 minutes. Uugghh! I was getting frustrated. Went to the end where the noodle soup was. There was a line as well about six deep. Fell in line and a bit relieved it was pretty reasonable wait, about 10 minutes. Still...

And thanks to Terri for her advice prior to attending)   Off Rainbow and 215, the monastery is not seen from major roads. It's is aptly located on  Virtue Drive . There's plentiful parking both within the monastery and just outside the gates. I heard rumblings of the infamous chicken pad thai line, and thought I had gotten really lucky when I saw no humungous line present over the stall. In my rookie ignorance, I didn't realize the wait was so long, you actually put your name on a list (which was already 2 pages long by the time I got there), and you get your food when your name is called. If you are not around when they call your name, they'll give your order to the next person in line who is around. We waited 40 minutes for our pad thai, which was fine since we could walk around the other stalls and see what others had to offer. Some of my favorite offerings were the chicken curry puffs, this sweetened pork in rice flour and their roti (which wasn't crispy, but had a lot of flavor). There's so many more things we could have dined out, but I think we did good for our first go around. Everyone seems to use very fresh ingredients and the quality of items rival that of busy Thai restaurants in SF and Vegas. There's plenty of covered carport seating if you'd like to eat there or they can wrap up everything for you to go. I very much appreciated the friendly community vibe of the folks attending and it was a great way to spend a Sunday morning.", "Date": "2015-11-22", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Deli", "ReviewID": "qYK20ZHDxkA8Ylc4da4QTg", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Am neither Thai nor a monk nor a Buddhist.  I'm a certified glutton though so food was the only reason I came to the  Monastery for, for the very first time (I went on Sunday, the 28th of August).   From my fond food experience on my frequent trips to the San Fernando Valley/North Hollywood's Wat Thai Buddhist Temple's weekend food fair, I was hoping (and expecting based on Yelp reviews) that Chaiya would deliver and be worth the trip (considering Vegas was experiencing 100plus degree summer heat.)    Parking wasn't too bad.  In fact, there was ample.  As I was walking in, I noticed their festival schedule posted so I updated and added on to my phone's reminder apps the dates of their future scheduled food fairs until December 18, 2016.  As I entered the compound, there were, understandably, lines and cliques of people.  Come to find out the lines were of people ordering and  not-too-amused  people waiting for their food.  There's about 10 or fewer tables offering and selling very limited Thai dishes.  There's, of course, the ubiquitous pad thai.  There's few other more noodle dishes, moo yahng, papaya salad, vermicelli soup, fried battered bananas/taro/yam, some desserts and fresh produce/herbs/plants.  I queued and waited in in 4 different lines and was told by the cashiers that there's another 20 to 30-minute wait for the food (that's on top of the almost half an hour standing in line).  That's  an agonizing 1 1/2 hours just to place my orders.  After which, I waited another hour or so while I joined the group of unhappy people blocking the cashier's tables and listened to their bitchings and whinings about the long wait and the heat.  If the monks could only hear them nasty mouths!    Yelp reviewers were singing high praises for the authenticity of their pad thai so why not go for the  authentic  Chicken Pad Thai, along with som tum (papaya salad), moo yahng (pork satay) and banana fritters (my  to-go  dessert and for the road).    THE VERDICT:   Pad thai came with a decent portion of cooked noodles and 3 chicken slices,  a teaspoon of ground peanuts, a teaspoon of white sugar, some ground red pepper flakes, 13 bean sprouts, a 1/8 slice of lime.  I couldn't believe I waited almost 45 minutes for a noodle dish I could've bought and enjoyed from a neighborhood Thai restaurant in Henderson.  I didn't mix in the sugar that came with it and yet it came out and tasted overly sweet.  Authentic Pad Thai would've been an interplay of what Thai food is known for ( i.e., interplay of at least three and up to four or five fundamental taste senses in each dish or the overall meal: sour, sweet, salty, bitter, and spicy).  The pad thai i had was a  complex interplay   of 4!:  sweet, very sweet, very very sweet, and oh so freaking sweet!    I must've had 3 bites and chased it with papaya salad dressed with dark brown fish anchovy sauce akin to the Filipino  bagoong isda  and not your typical Thai nam pla.   In fairness, the som tum was decent, and so were the barbecued skewered meat .  After a good 15 minutes, I grabbed the bag of banana fritters and left.  I left hungry, wanting more and borderline hyperglycemic.  It was not the same, not even close to Wat Thai Temple's.  I had better.  Not too happy but then again it was for a good cause and $25 more towards the monastery's mortgage fund.    EPILOGUE:  As I was driving towards the main road, I stopped by the corner, turned my phone''s Reminders App and deleted the entry I made when I first walked in.  And when I got home, the monks (blessed their holy virtuous hearts) got their revenge because when I opened the brown bag of what I thought were banana fritters, turned out to be a bag of fried but now soggy battered taro root!

Rocks. Dirt. Sand. BADASS MONASTERY!!!  Southwest Vegas is painfully notorious for being home to just about nothing, except - SURPRISE! We have a monastery in the middle of a residential neighborhood. And one Sunday every month, it becomes home to a mini street fair maxed out with Southeast Asian delights.   You pay up front with cash to an adorable little lady for fair currency, which you can exchange back into dollars if you have any leftover coins. This is also the same lady who is the gatekeeper to the famed curry puffs - a sweetened curry paste enveloped in a flaky crust - that must be ordered one fair's time in advance, $5 for 7 puffs. Here you can trade in your usual brunch staples of waffles and eggs Benedict for a piping hot bowl of stew pork noodle or made to order pad thai.   There isn't too much bilingual signage beyond the entrance, especially for the food, but all of the items are homemade and all of the vendors are very proud of their work, so they're more than willing to explain all of the ingredients to those of you who show up as clueless as I did.", "Date": "2013-12-27", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
