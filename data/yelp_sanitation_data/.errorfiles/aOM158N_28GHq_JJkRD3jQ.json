Luckily I'm not the only one who has some serious gripes with the service at this location. Actually, it is a possibility that we had the same clueless, passive aggressive waitress who had no clue what was going on.  Seeing as this place is open 24/7 and has some really good combination plates for breakfast you can't really go wrong. A great tip is to order the Weekday Special(don't worry about what is written on the menu, not even the price is correct). Every time I order it they make it fast, delicious, and $2 less than menu price which sits well with my Jewish ass.   Recently we have been running into the late night creepy/awful wait staff but the fast, delicious food more than makes up for it. Their omelets are always fluffy and tasty and their pancakes really hit the spot. Just make sure to say your order slowly and clearly enough so that the half brain-dead staff can give you what you really want. 24/7 breakfast that doesn't make you feel like death(*cough*IHOP*cough*) deserves at least 4 stars but the subpar wait staff really drags this location down.", "Date": "2010-12-12", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jade", "ReviewID": "Qfs5K09cs-JV5Vlumt_DuQ", "Overall": "2", "Content": "We came here since our original destination had a grease fire and closed for the next hour.  Breakfast sounded kinda good so the BF and I grabbed:  Denver Pancakes- these were okay. They would be better a bit crispier since I like my hash browns crisp.  There was confusion on the ordering though. You can get a la carte and just get the pancakes, a combo which is  served with two eggs any style and choice of: applewood bacon, sausage links or turkey sausage patty, or you can go deluxe which says  served with three breakfast meats: applewood bacon, savory ham and sausage links or turkey sausage patty. Only $1 more to upgrade from a combo . The server asked if I wanted it as a combo. I said no, I want to go deluxe and let me have sunny side and I picked pork sausage links over the turkey patty.   The meal comes out and I have sausage links and denver pancakes. I asked where the other meat and eggs and she goes  oh thats why I asked if you wanted a combo ....which I didn't because I want it as a deluxe and either way a combo or a deluxe has eggs and I did say what style of eggs I wanted and it was written down so she goes looks and realizes I did order it. So then she asked what choice of other meat I want for my deluxe and I said, it comes with all of them but then she just sounded really confused like and kept saying its a choice of and was getting frustrated like  I was not ordering right so I just said give me bacon. Choice of- combo, 3 meats deluxe....I don't work there, but I can read that right on the menu. She didn't charge me for the bacon or eggs, but it is still not what I ordered and I don't get why it was hard to get that the deluxe has a little bit of everything. The was the point- I wanted a variety and I didn't get what I sought after. Also she said something about the chef was missing so she apparently cooked it.... (that's kinda weird) the bacon was crispy burnt, the eggs over easy, not sunny side.   BF got corned beef hash which has eggs, home potatoes and then you get a choice of bread or pancakes. He upgraded to red velvet pancakes. It was all pretty okay, but nothing remarkable.   It's not the best breakfast out there, but late night it'll do. I would usually say  that it's a wide variety breakfast platter bang for your buck place, but not tonight. For the fact it was difficult to get something straight forward and on their menu I can't really give more than 2 stars,  meh I've had better  on a place that will never really have outstanding food so it really tanks when service isn't there.   She was nice enough....but that isn't enough to make up for the confusion. Just don't order anything  complicated  I guess.", "Date": "2010-11-23", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Norm", "ReviewID": "OpmTY3TB9cRIw6G7i-M8Lg", "Overall": "2", "Content": "Dinner last night was fine for me but not so for my wife so I'll give it 2.5 stars.  I had a grilled chicken breast with bruschetta topping.  The bruschetta was seasoned nicely, and I thought the dish was OK.  My wife had a grilled chicken breast with a basil and garlic sauce.  There was no basil seasoning in the sauce at all and only a small amount of garlic.  She said the broccoli side tasted spoiled.  It may be better when Coco's goes and the Grand Cafe comes back.  I'll wait and see.\", "Date": "2011-02-04", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Lily", "ReviewID": "kqP9KX10IjkLumf4BQbhfA", "Overall": "3", "Content": "I'm slightly surprised to see the low ratings for this place. I would actually give it a 3.5 stars. This is a place I used to dine frequently. Mainly because they were conveniently located at Santa Fe Station which is down the street to me.  I agree their service can be pretty bad sometimes, especially more recently. Maybe it might be because they will be closing soon as the Grand Cafe will be reopening in it's place...  The food and the service used to be better but it really has gone downhill. Though I still enjoy their bakery. And their seasonal menu is still interesting. I must say I do enjoy their sweet potato fries.  Their croissant sandwich is also yummy.   Try to stay away from chicken or broccoli here, I have had pieces that were bitter. eww. But you can't go wrong with their desserts, they are yummy! From the cookies to seasonal pies, etc. I went there around 4pm to have breakfast one day (it is served 24 hours but you have to ask for the breakfast menu. But the servers have no clue have to serve breakfast and what it comes with). I was so excited to find they had red velvet pancakes! But it was such a fail. The flavor and texcture of the pancakes were not good. And because it wasn't a breakfast server, she didn't know about a whipped cream cheese that should've came with it. Overall just not good...  When Coco's is gone, I might miss it. Mainly for their bakery.  This review is long overdue and I can't even remember the details. Overall, though, I do like this place for a quick bite and some sweets when I happen to be at Santa Fe Station, but would not go out of my way to dine here.", "Date": "2011-02-21", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Nicole", "ReviewID": "UdzWNS55-ZDNKh_AhHzHuQ", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Huge fan of this coco's.  The service is is excellent. There has only been one time that we haven't received excellent service and the manager made sure to make things right. She comp'd our meal (we were in a group of 8) & gave us a free meal the next time we come (since we were regulars). Didn't expect that. But i assume its because we were here celebrating with family the fact that my hubby and I had just gotten married and were pregnant.  The next time we came we ordered an app, two entrees and drinks and it all came to be free. how nice!   Will always come back.", "Date": "2011-05-07", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
