Location: They are located off of Sunset road, before the intersection of Sunset & Mt. Vista. It a freestanding building, you can't miss the sign.   Ambiance: Inside it looks like a typical Asian restaurant, nothing fancy. It was clean which was a plus.  Service: The waitress was very friendly and helpful with the menu. She gave me recommendations since it was my first time. Service time was standard.  Food: I ordered the duck sliders for appetizers. It was pretty good. I ordered off of the special menu, which was buy one get one free. I ordered 2 ramen, Taiwanese beef noodle soup, and cold Vietnamese noodles (to go). First of all, the portions was HUGE, which is always good with me. The ramen was pretty good but needed some fixing up. A little soy sauce and Sriracha made it all better. Same went for the Taiwanese beef noodle soup with a little help I turned a 5 into an 8. For the price you can't beat it. The Vietnamese cold noodles I took it home which made a wonderful late night snack.   Value: The special menu is great! Buy one get one free, you can't go wrong. Four meals for $16 is a steal. Especially with the portions being so huge you gotta love it.   *tips: order off the special menu it's buy one get one free. If you are using groupons you can't use it in combination with the specials menu. If you're alone you can still get that BOGO free deal and take one to go.  I gave them a 3 out of 5 because I gotta keep it really. It isn't the greatest, but for the price you can't go wrong.

Their Green Smoothie is not so heavy on the spinach, but has more strawberries and banana in it. That was the predominant flavors. The boba had a nice consistency, too.  Definitely get the duck sliders to start because I would have made a meal out of those alone. The meat is juicy, tender, and crisp. The bao is fried slightly to give it even more texture.   I don't recommend the tom yum soup. It was not very wow worthy. It fell flat in the tang and tasted cheap. The Singapore noodles with beef was delicious. The beef was cooked beautifully.

First of all, the service was terrible. It took forever to get our order taken, the three dishes came out at three different times (they seem to have an aversion to trays), and there were about 5 workers all chillin' on their cell phones in plain sight in the restaurant.   My main complaint: the menu clearly states that the lunch specials are served daily 11am-4pm. Perfect! We were there on a Sunday around 2pm. Love it. Can't wait to get the vegetable Pad Thai lunch special. Our first server did not make mention of the fact that they were not honoring their own menu specifications, so we had all decided on lunch specials. Then, our second server (yes, two servers...remember how I said the service was annoying?) said as we were looking at the lunch specials,  Oh, we're not doing those today.  Umm, okay, that would have been nice to know. Inform your patrons upon seating them that you're not going to allow your own printed specials.   Whatever though, I overlooked it and ordered the dinner serving of Pad Thai. It was good, very good even, but I was so off-put by the terrible service and their deciding to  not do those  lunch specials on the Sundays that I believe the place warrants two stars.

Circle K is one of my fave places on earth, and the other day I went to get a soda to relax at home and crochet the day away when I decided to pop by and grab a quick dinner to take with me. Now someone mentioned a drive thru, this may be open only certain days, cause when I went it was filled with cars and not operating. Which is more than fine with me so I headed on in.   Their menu is amazing! Very good variety of different types of noodle cuisine. They have Taiwanese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Thai and Chinese. (There may be more, sorry.) I tried the Taiwanese spicy noodle special on my first visit. it was pretty good, good chunks of meat and lots of veggies. I went back a few nights later and ordered a bunch of takeout for a smorgasbord. I ordered two shashu ramens, lettuce wraps and orange sliver beef. The shashu ramen was ok, I felt the broth was lacking so I added some more soy sauce and chili oil when I got home. The lettuce wraps were delicious, I do wish they would just do the lettuce and filling separate though, I like building them myself. Plus, half was saved for the boyfriends lunch next day but there was no way to heat them up without lettuce getting gross. Now the 0range sliver beef....Holy crap! That stuff was the bomb! SO good I had to wrap it up in the fridge so I would have leftovers.   My only suggestion is to please make your descriptions on your menu easier to decipher, and place make your boba to-go glasses bigger for the price you are charging. Telling me the broth is taiwanese style is not helpful unless I am from Taiwan and know what that means, you have to be an ambassador for your product.

But food underneath looked, smelled and tasted good. Plenty of food served and didn't skimp.  We ordered the #33 Thai Tom Kha Gai Rice Noodle Soup. NO GO. They don't have that anymore.  So closest thing that sounded like it and almost the same ingredients minus the coconut milk was #32 Thai Tom Yum Goong Rice Noodle Soup. i loved the bold lemongrass flavor with a spicy kick. Really good taste and a huge bowl enough for 2 people.  Restaurant was clean and service was good.  Ordered Overall good experience. But the frozen appetizer started it bad and I couldn't shake the thought that it all was all going to be bad because i almost left. I was a little worried because the seemed to have everything and specialize in not one type of Asian food. Should get 3 1/2 stars but no spot for it.

Here it was a lot different. Even though it was in the soup section it had no broth! What I got was a bowl that had raw carrots, cucumbers, and celery on one side. The other had noodles, that looked identical to those in a 15 cent ramen packet. No flavor. On the bottom was a thick sauce, almost like a gravy that had chunks of pork. Again not much flavor.

This place fulfills the latter.  We came here with a groupon (if you read my reviews, you'll find that's often the case for me) and were promptly seated. It seemed to be a typically slow week night. No matter, we perused the menus at our leisure. I noticed they do the  pan-asian  thing, which is to say that they don't really offer any one particular style of asian food but instead offer a little bit of everything. I'm not generally a fan of such a model because I feel it detracts from the potential quality you can get if you concentrate your efforts into mastering one particular style of cooking. However, these guys proved me wrong and managed to pull off a decent meal for both of us.   We bided our time with some tasty edamame. It was salty and delicious. After much debate, I ended up choosing the kimchi beef fried rice (obviously a dish inspired in part by korean flavors) while my girlfriend chose the singapore noodles with chicken. First things first-- the portion sizes are are very impressive for the price. I really don't think they should be listed as a $$ restaurant-- one entree is more than enough food for two people, and you can get many things here for less than ten dollars. We ended up getting pretty stuffed and had plenty left over.   My fried rice was the most interesting I have ever tasted. They added just enough kimchi to keep the flavor unique in every bite. It also was not overpoweringly spicy, which may be a good thing depending on your palate's limitations. I could have done with a bit more meat, but the rice itself tasted pretty fresh, and it was not overly greasy. The singapore noodles were also excellent. No shortage of meat there. They used angel hair pasta, a bit of saffron, and indian spices to create a very unique dish-- the likes of which I have never experienced. To me, new flavors are good (usually) and this place ended up being a pleasant surprise. They offer many other dishes with other countries of inspiration, and I do look forward to trying them soon.", "Date": "2012-11-09", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Barry", "ReviewID": "ubcL6VvokiJmv5q_YwNquQ", "Overall": "4", "Content": "My office is close by and I am always down for some good Chinese food.

We wash our meal down with the Green Apple Green Tea, sooo good.  The only criticism  I can give is the servers. They are never busy, and tend to hover around you waiting for you to look up and pounce on you. My big peeve with them is they bring food out at different times, like as soon as it is done. So my husband gets his starter, I watch him eat, then my main course comes followed by starter, then he gets his meal. Bring food orders out together no matter if it sits in the kitchen for a minute.

The first time we met there, they had barely joined the throes of Vegas new restaurants, and in this cursed location, I was wary.  The drinks (boba) took forever, we did not get water until after we got our food, and the service was eh.  It was lunch and they had specials, so we had to work at spending the groupon amount.  I had pho that was not memorable.  I remember it now because last night Susan D. and I tried to figure out what I had, and I remembered that I had tried making my own pho the night before and it was a flop, so I had some here to redeem myself.    What was memorable though were the Peking duck sliders for the appetizer.  The steamed buns are fried, with Peking duck and hoisin sauce inside and a side of cucumbers and scallions.  After the next round of groupons came out, we both purchased one, but mine was in Eric R.'s account and he is out of town, so Susan D. and I decided to have a late dinner at Noodle ChaCha last night after I finished teaching.  This was planned in advance, and apparently was the latest she had ever eaten dinner!  Our server was very nice and we got our waters and drinks quickly.  She had a smoothie and I ordered hot green tea.  We immediately did an order of the duck sliders.  They were just as good as we remembered.  The hard part is there are many dishes on the menu with duck so I could have had more duck - duck salad, duck soup, duck noodles.  Yet I was doing the hot tea thing to prevent getting sick since I encounter a zillion students a day, and so I opted for soup.  I ordered the tom yum goong.  It was HUUUUUGE.  A bowl full of spicy lemongrass-galangal broth with kaffir lime leaves, rice noodles, mushrooms, and huge shrimp.  It was very tasty and satisfying.  I also liked that my nose ran from the heat.  Susan D. had the Noodle ChaCha fried rice with the huge shrimp and she was happy with her dish and smoothie.  We had a good experience and will return.  I recommend for first timers the Peking duck sliders and the tom yum goong (if you like spiciness).  There are so many other dishes to choose from though from various Asian influences.

I think it was the best thing I ordered.  Tried the other food with the family, the HK noodles were good, the sauce was fine, and the noodles crispy,  The chow fun was really oily, but it tasted like it was suppose to.  The beef on the other hand wasn't what we expected.  It was really thin, like the beef in pho, had no teriyaki and there was so much rice.  I would not order that again.
