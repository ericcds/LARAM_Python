It was my boyfriend's birthday, I decided to come here as a surprise.  I left him in the car and explained that I was doing a surprise dinner and the waitress took my order and sat us in a secluded area without a hitch.  +1 Star.  Upon entrance into the dining room the perfume of a sweet curry fills your nose and starts your appetite.  I had ordered two appetizers - pork satay and the summer rolls.  The pork satay was beyond description - buttery and slightly charred - absolutely delicious.  +1 Star.  The summer rolls were crisp and fresh.  The shrimp in the rolls were a beautiful pink colour and perfectly cleaned.  +1 Star.  I had ordered two entrees - crispy duck and the pho dac biet xe lua.  The crispy duck was very good, although the garlic was a little strong and the duck was not crispy.  +1/2 Star.  The pho dac biet xe lia was awesome!  The broth with additions was flavourful and robust.  It contained a generous portion of all the meats and delectable bits of tripe and marrow.  +1 Star.

The calamari was really good.  The salad veggies tasted fresh.  And I really liked the nuts in it, it gave it a nice crunchy mix.  The dressing was very good, but I thought there was a little too much of it on the salad.    It left a bit of an aftertaste.   I did like the fact that I could hear in the kitchen as they were making the salad, hearing everything being chopped up and mixed - fresh and homemade.    For some reason, I didn't care for the tea.  Perhaps it wasn't hot enough.  The service I thought was OK, not great, but not bad either.   Functional, but lacking the  warm and friendly  factor I think is so important for these types of places.    Also I think the physical presentation factor of the place could be improved.  It looks  hit-or-miss  from the outside, and if it weren't for the good yelp reviews, I doubt I would have given it a shot.  Inside, I think there are probably small things they can do to help increase the atmosphere factor.  Right now it lacks something.  That said, I think this place has potential.

The atmosphere is nice and laid back with plenty of space.  They serve wine and beer.    Overall my experience here was pleasant, mostly due to our server.  However, I have mixed feelings about the Thai food here.  Let's get started.  A friend and I ordered the Sam Rot with chicken ($9.95), the red duck curry ($16.95), and the Lilly's chicken wings appetizer ($6.95).  I have had Sam Rot before, so my opinion probably isn't well educated here, but it seemed like a sweet dish.  It was lightly fried and served with a sweet slightly sour and savory sauce.  It was well prepared, no grease, and had a nice light (although sweet) flavor.  Interesting, but not overly impressive.  The Lilly's chicken wings were well done as well, but again lightly sweet.  The style seemed slightly Chinese.  They were good though so no complaints.  The duck curry is where I had a little disappointment.  The serving at first seemed large enough, but upon further examination there was very little duck for the price.  A well known Thai restaurant nearby has three times the amount of duck for nearly the same price.  The duck itself was tender and not gristly.  It was well prepared.  The curry was very light on this dish, and used more like a sauce.  It had a good flavor but was a little bit too sweet.  The cooked veggies were good but nothing to rave about.    Overall this is a decent Thai restaurant.  Would I return?  Well the menu is large, but the food seems a little too sweet for my Thai tastes.  I would like to explore some of the other menu items though.", "Date": "2012-09-12", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Linh", "ReviewID": "uST_WLr3L2FTi5gRAkcxAw", "Overall": "1", "Content": "This restaurant is kinda hidden.

I was put off a bit by the exterior -  Vietnamese and Thai Restaurant  in hand-painted letters made it look like a take-out joint.  Inside it was rather plain, too well-lit, and lacked much atmosphere, but didn't look like a take-out place.    The menu was huge, and it was hard to decide what to order:  Thai? Vietnamese? Chinese?  Our friend is Vietnamese, so she helped us choose which Pho to order.  The Pho was absolutely delicious!  We also asked for two orders of the Vietnamese Spring Rolls, and she even repeated the Vietnamese name.  But when the first of the two orders came out, it was the fried roll, not the healthier unfried one our friend specified.  Our waitress seemed flustered, didn't speak English very well, and apparently was Thai, and not Vietnamese.  She also didn't seem to have very much experience.  The other hubby ordered the Calamari and he liked it;  I tasted it and it was way too greasy for me.  Our Asian friend had a dish with pork rinds and rice, and when it was served, she was dismayed by the tiny portion of pork;  she said that at other places, there's usually a big mound of it.  Here, she had to do extensive digging before she could even find it.  We also got two orders of Pad Thai, one with shrimp, the other with chicken.  Wee all found it too sweet, and I thought it was unsufferably sweet.  Other than the Pho, there is nothing compelling about the food here, and the service didn't make up for it.  If it weren't for the Pho, I'd be giving Lilly's two stars.  But I guess I'm in the minority, since other reviewers seem to disagree with me.

We came here a few weeks ago for lunch with our $30 Groupon in hand.   I started with a Thai tea and my fella got a regular iced tea. The Thai tea was a little on the sweeter side than I would have preferred, but was good. We decided to share a panang curry with pork and a chicken pad thai to share.The curry was pretty good, but I had hoped it would be a little thicker and flavorful. It was just a little more watered down than I had expected. The pad thai was on the slimy side. It wasn't the most pleasant texture, but aside from the texture it had a good flavor, albeit a little on the sweet side.. We finished our meal with a mango and sticky rice. I can never resist sticky rice, so was happy with this rendition. I think I would prefer the coconut ice cream next time to the mango since it wasn't the freshest, but it was a nice way to end our meal.

Tippy was our waitress, and she really does try her best.  However, the food was just a-ok.  Nothing special or worth remembering from this place.  I've been to many Thai restaurants in Vegas, and Lilly's would probably rank as one of the lowest in terms of how good the food is.  Pin Kaow, Archis and Komol are far by superior - by a long shot.    The panang was so-so, and the pad see ew was ok at best.  They didn't ask what level of heat you preferred on any of their dishes which is strange for a thai restaurant.  We ordered the Lilly's appetizer sampler, and it was $14.95 for 3 pieces of calamari (teeny tiny pieces), two whole egg rolls cut in half, two pieces of fried shrimp and 3 little dumplings about the size of a quarter.

We came here with high expectations after reading some of the reviews here. Ordered the Tom Kai gai, viet spring rolls, the pad Thai, pho bo, and panang curry chicken between the 2 of us. After tasting them all, I've concluded that this is the worst Thai/Viet restaurant I have yet to try in the entire Las Vegas area. The pho was absolutely tasteless, almost like water and noodles, and even with some hoisin sauce it just tasted like water with noodles with hoisin sauce. The curry looked like it came out of a fast food place, the carrots and chicken were so horribly cut they look like they were made by a 5 year old, and the sauce was way too salty. The Tom Kai gai was too creamy, it was literally like coconut cream with some chicken in it. Maybe I've gone to Lotus of Siam too recently to have my tastes spoiled, but after trying 5 dishes I can safely say that I don't know what every other review says is right, perhaps it's even contrived.  She says...  Coming from a Vietnamese gal, I really have to say the broth of the Pho was extremely tasteless. I never seen a restaurant who did not bring out the hoisin and hot sauce when serving Pho. I had to ask the servers for it and after having the sauces for 5 minutes, the servers took it back as if they only had one set. I understand that there might be a possibility that the chef forgot  to add the flavors but we did not receive an apology after telling the server about the Pho. Pad Thai was the best out of all we ordered I have to say. Panang curry was wayyyy to salty. Even with the white rice didn't help hide the saltiness. Servers was very attentive, too much I say, but maybe because we were the only table there at 7:30pm on a Sunday night. I'm usually not to critical when it comes to food but I could not say anything for this restuarant.

Because the Chinese and Vietnamese was a bit cheaper, we ended up getting Thai dishes, along with an appetizer, dessert, and two Thai iced teas.  The prices were fair and portions were big.  The only thing that seemed a little off was the price of the Thai teas, which were $3.95 each!  That's definitely high, and the drinks weren't big or anything.   But everything else was really good.

When we walked in, we were pretty much given a warm welcome by everyone and seated at a nice table by the window. The waiter gave us both the regular menu and the lunch special menu and asked us if we had any coupons. We debated on whether we were going to get lunch specials or use the certificate, but since they already took it we figured we might as well. The menu had a VERY large selection with one side being Thai and the other being Vietnamese. Since we originally came here for Thai food, we decided to stick with our plan. We ordered Calamari, Beef Pad Thai, Chicken Panang, Lychee drink, Thai Coffee, and the Fried banana with ice cream dessert.   The drinks came first and we were both in love. The Thai Coffee I got was was light and tasty. Sometimes i get Thai Coffee or Tea and it's just waay too sweet or concentrated. This one was made perfectly. The Lychee drink, however, was the star of the whole meal. It was SOO delicious! It tasted just like the Lychee Jelly cups I used to eat when I was a kid. Don really had to try hard not to drink it all at once.   They brought out the Calamari first. It didn't really strike me as calamari at first sight/taste. It was extremely crunchy and fried, but I really enjoy crunchy food. I actually tasted the batter a lot more than the Calamari itself. It was served with a little cucumber/peanut salad and sweet/sour sauce. We left a few pieces and ended up eating them during our meal, but by then they were kind of cold and a little soggy and the flavor just wasn't good, so I suggest you don't let it sit for a while. The Panang Curry wasn't as flavorful as what I'm used to; it had a more subtle taste, but it was okay. The Pad Thai was very good though. The noodles and meat were both perfectly cooked.   After eating our entrees, we decided to try their Fried Banana and Ice Cream (coconut). The presentation was very nice (http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wWrB4eU6MmK4J9I_8vzOPQ/l.jpg). The banana pieces were so small, especially since they were all surrounded in wrapping, but they still went very well with the coconut ice cream, which was very fresh (not icy at all).   Overall, we definitely plan on coming back here. Next time, we'll be trying items from their Vietnamese menu!

For main courses, my wife ordered their garlic stir fry with chicken.  It was just the way she likes it, lots of garlic and a good amount of chicken with some vegetables.  I ordered the soft shell crab in garlic curry sauce.  They didn't ask me about a spiciness level and I didn't specify one.  It was a mild curry, but it was very good.  The crab was on top of asparagus and some yellow squash and zucchini.  The presentation of both dishes was very good.  For dessert, I tried the custard-Thai style.  It's more like a piece of bread pudding.  It was very flavorful and quite enjoyable.  My wife got some green tea ice cream.  We enjoyed our meal a lot!

Stir fried noodle in house sauce w/ vegetables and seafood was tasty.  It packed just the right amount of flavor for me, and I would not hesitate to order it in the future.  The Crispy Duck, made with boneless duck, lightly battered and topped with Chef's special sauce was good. Big portion, but the nice crispy duck was covered in sauce.  I was told that was the traditional country style presentation of that dish. I still like it, but felt that it was a shame to undo the crispy duck skin at plating. I liked this duck dish, but will tried one of the other duck items on the menu in the future.  Service was great.  Food was brought out promptly.

The servers were nice and they have a nice beer collection but the food is not good.", "Date": "2012-08-17", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Say", "ReviewID": "QZE0Plycy7tfbYcAlHZIqw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Thank you for all the support but we are no longer at this location.

Upon looking at the menu, I was instantly impressed.  What we ordered: Lychee Drink - Yummy.. actual pieces of Lychee.  Mmmm. Thai Coffee-  Very good here.  I recommend it. Vietnamese Spring Rolls- Nothing fancy here Calamari- Very good, it tasted very fresh. Beef Panang Curry-  We always order this when we do Thai.  We were not impressed. Chicken Pad Thai-  Pretty good.  We nearly finished it. Deep Fried Banana w/ Coconut Ice Cream-  Had strawberries in it.  I liked it, but I don't think I'd order it again...  It was really good, just very sweet!  Pros:   * There is an extensive menu that is separated Thai & Vietnamese ( I liked the layout)   *  Lunch specials available.  Decently priced.    *  Lychee Drink.  Yes this is a plus!  I love Lychee!!   *  Good sized portions   * Attentive server.     *  I loved the Thai Coffee here.   Cons:   *  I noticed there were spring rolls on the Vietnamese menu, but the server pointed out the spring rolls on the Thai side of the menu.  He insisted I order that instead... if I'm not mistaken, it was a dollar more?  I just found that a bit confusing.  *  The beverages were a bit over-priced.  Nearly $3 each for Thai Coffee and Lychee.  * Panang Curry.  We were not impressed.  In Lilly's defense, the veggie cuts in the Panang Curry were larger than usual and did have a more fresh taste.  It's just that it was not as flavorful when in comparison to other places where we had this dish.  Tips:   *  Make sure to eat your Calamari while its still hot.  It doesn't taste as great after it gets to room temperature (I've never had this problem when ordering Calamari elsewhere).  Also if you want a lemon wedge with your Calamari, you'll have to ask for it.   *  The dessert was big enough for 2 to share.     *  I know some Thai restaurants use a 1-10 scale for level of heat, but at Lilly's they just ask if like it mild, medium, or hot.  Just a heads up.    Overall,  I plan on coming back.  I liked nearly everything we ordered and I'm anxious to try out the rest of the restaurant's offerings (maybe next time, I'll focus more on the Vietnamese side of the menu).  A place where you can order both Pho and Pad Thai... I'm a fan!", "Date": "2012-01-13", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Kelly", "ReviewID": "c3PTB3lF2zQMbsvaabHg3A", "Overall": "2", "Content": "This was our first and last visit for dinner using a $10 Restaurant.com coupon.  It was hidden in a small strip mall on W Sahara Ave/near S Rainbow Blvd in Las Vegas.  When we walked in, the owner gestured for us to sit down.  There was only a party of three there with a coupon. A woman walked in with a Groupon and the owner said they are no longer accepting Groupons so she walked out.    They do not have a website but they do have a Facebook page.  They had Chinese, Thai, and Vietnamese items on the menu.  The Vietnamese food was reasonably priced.  The curry, duck, seafood, and some of the specialty entrees were expensive.  The tables had burgundy table cloths covered with glass.  A single Cala Lily was in a vase at each table.  Rap music was playing.  The owner took our order, left the menu in our hands and then brought us glasses of water 10 minutes after we walked in.  My friend ordered the Shrimp and Pork Noodle Bowl and I ordered the Shrimp Rice Plate.  We also ordered the Summer Rolls.  The two Summer Rolls came out on a plate with peanut sauce.  They were not cut in half.  I like my Summer Rolls to be cut in half.  There was no mint or shredded carrot garnish like on the Facebook page.  About 25 minutes after we arrived, the owner told me that thay were out of white steamed rice.  He asked me if I wanted brown rice or noodles.  I said noodles were okay.  Why didn't he tell me that when I ordered #34?  What Asian restaurant runs out of white rice during prime dinner time?  The owner was also the cook.  I could see him frying something.  A young Asian guy walked in and started clearing plates from the other party's table.  He must have been out on a delivery.  The Shrimp and Pork Noodle Bowl had 3 boiled or barely grilled shrimp on a skewer with yellow squash and sliced carrot.  There was about 2 tablespoons of BBQ pork. There was shredded carrot and peanut garnish.  The Shrimp Rice Plate was now a noodle bowl with 2 skewers of 5 shrimp and vegetables with a garnish of shredded carrot and chopped peanuts.  It was served with fish sauce.  I had to ask for a spicy tray to give the entree some flavor.  We did not get a refill of water nor did the owner check on us.

We decided to try this place out coz there was a $50 gift cert deal from restaurants.com (must order $100 worth of food,there was 6 of us) and after reading yelp reviews from others(I should've listened to the negative ones, I AM open minded about reviews though, and I figured that the reason behind the negative reviews was because they were not Asian and they were just not used to Asian food, coz most of the reviews  from asians said good things about the place, WELL I AM ASIAN and here is MAI review.) I really don't want to be a hater, but the dining public has to be WARNED. the whole dining experience to SUM it all up was DISAPPOINTING & the food was UNSAVORY, MSG filled and OVERPRICED. I went on an MSG induced coma after that dinner. Now i am going to give you our orders by the $$$  $9 minced pork lettuce wrap (way too salty with frozen veggies), $11fried calamari (very greasy and it was mostly batter little squid), $4 Vietnamese fried spring rolls (2 pcs of mediocre egg rolls) $9BBQ pork(bland no flavor, it wasn't what I wanted anyways, I asked the waitress if they were on skewers and she said yes and they weren't) $9 grilled pork meatball(5 tiny pieces with lettuce and limp noodles, mediocre at best) THATs just appetizers! For entrees we had $8 Pho Dac Biet (contrary to other reviews it was not good. The soup did not taste like real beef broth at all) $10 lemon grass steak (small pieces of beef with tons of  overcooked veggies, green onions mostly, I did not see nor taste any lemon grass, too salty) $9 Singapore noodles (again wrong info from waitress, seems like she just answers yes to every question asked...hmmm) honestly I really did not understand the flavor of this dish, it was not good too. $19 sea bass with ginger sauce, the sauce was good, but the fish was not fresh, it was flaky & dry. $5 Tom yum gai soup bowl (supposed to be with shrimp instead of chicken, but language barrier once again) it was ok, nothing special, the chicken had a stench to it, my nose is really sensitive to that kind of stuff.) DRINKS $3 lychee juice(ok), $3 Thai lemonade (too sweet) DESSERT $6 mango with sticky rice (mangoes were sour, sticky rice & coconut sauce ok) Which leads us to a GRAND total of $153 including 18% gratuity & tax, less $50 gift cert we paid $103 out of pocket, divided between 5 adults, it was $20/person. Now don't get me wrong am not whining about the price nor did I say that the servers where rude, I just thought it was a huge RIP OFF and for the %18 tip we had to leave the service was at best mediocre (they should provide an interpreter) Needless to say I learned my lesson, sometimes what you think is a good DEAL might turn out to be a RIP OFF. Needless to say we are DEFINITELY NOT COMING BACK HERE & I HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!

(If you can live without brown rice.) We stopped in for our midday meal, and we were greeted with friendly, attentive service even though they were training a new waitress who couldn't answer all of our questions. However, we ask a lot of goofy questions (can we get this with broccoli only, or that with more garlic, is this a good one, and so on). They were very eager for feedback and special orders did not upset them.   The menu is huge, so it is hard to imagine they can do it all well. We went with some basic stir fry dishes on their lunch specials menu. Fresh, generous and saucy are the three adjectives I would choose. I ordered the garlic chicken with broccoli only, and later in the day, driving down the highway I realized I had an entire chunk of fresh garlic wedged between my back teeth. Not so great for the breath, and perhaps a bit too much information, but a perfect indicator that the chef here is chopping up the cloves by the dozen and cooking them up on the spot in the dishes. The waitress said,  If you like garlic, you will not be disappointed,  and she was right! It was very flavorful.   The lunch special comes with a spring roll and is $6.95. A little cup of soup would be a nice addition to the lunch price, but I had enough to eat.   One disappointment was the lack of brown rice. We are avoiding white rice as much as possible these days, so the husband went without rice. I ate about half of the jasmine rice they served, and it was good, just the wrong color.
