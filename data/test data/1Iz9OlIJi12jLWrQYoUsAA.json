With the use of Yelp on my iPhone, my family and decided to try Chianti Cafe which was nearby.  We were thrilled with this place.  Nice quiet ambiance with delicous italian entrees.  The place has an air of sophistication but is not pretentious--very down to earth fine dining.  Service was excellent and friendly.   We ordered from the chef's additions to the menu of that day.  The orange roughy with the special sauce (which I cannot remember the name of) was excellent.  The Linquini with fresh clams (with shell and all) in white sauce was a treat.  The italian sausage rigatoni (they had a different name for it) was slightly bland for my taste, but, was still very good.  Great place.  We also like the baked bread with Tapenade while we waited.", "Date": "2009-06-10", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Paulie", "ReviewID": "WsuXYpTPvD06B7zJJmjBNA", "Overall": "1", "Content": "One of the worst dining experiences I have had in Las Vegas in recent memory.  We walked in and no one greeted us at the door.  Finally a gentleman who had walked by us before asked if we were looking for a table.  Finally we were seated.  We were taken to a table where there was a wine bucket with an empty bottle of wine next to it, which was moved away.  We sat down and the server proceeded to tell us about the items that were not available.  It was still early on a Friday and they were out of many high cost items including steak and clams.  We decided to order a glass of wine to start.  It seemed as if they were short staffed.  So everything took a very long time.  We ordered 2 glasses of wine and an order of bruschetta.  The server returned later with a bottle of wine and informed my husband that they were out of the wine he ordered as well and would he like to have a glass from the bottle she brought over.  Finally,  we got our bar order.  We had been seated for a while.  No bread came.  Then finally about 15 minutes later we were brought a mediocre loaf of white bread. (nothing special).  I went to use my bread plate but it was dirty, it looked clean but felt like it had a dirty film over it.  The bruschetta was finally delivered and it was nothing to get excited over.  The bread was not toasted and it was just chopped tomatoes and garlic on untoasted bread.    In the meantime there was a musician who was playing in the dining room.  He sang Billy Joel, Cat Stevens songs kind of your typical lounge songs.  I enjoyed listening to him.  It seemed as if most of the people there were coming to listen to his performance.  A party of 3 people came in to listen to him but 5 more joined them and they needed a bigger table.  They wanted to put 2 tables together but the waitress kept saying that someone would move their tables for them.  Finally, the manager? came over and moved the two tables for them inches away from our table.  We were literally an inch away from 2 people at the table yet there was plenty of room that they could have moved them to the other direction.   At this point my husband picked up our table and moved it out of the way.  No one really seemed to care or notice that we had moved ourselves.  At this point we decided to cut our losses and leave.  No service, no food, no clue!  We went in looking for a casual dinner out and left angry and frustrated.  Don't waste your money!", "Date": "2010-07-10", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Alana", "ReviewID": "3pgcknSFRgLwjChbDv3HYw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "I live very close by to this place and am so glad I found it!!! I have never had a bad experience here. The staff is so friendly and hospitable and make you feel as if you have been coming there forever on your first visit.  I love going here for a relaxing  dinner or drinks and appetizers at the bar with friends.  Anytime friends or family come to visit, my boyfriend and I always make sure to take them here.  The lobster ravioli is to die for, although I believe that is a limited item.  The bread and tapenade are always enjoyable. This is one place I definitely don't mind paying alittle more for.", "Date": "2009-06-26", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "jen", "ReviewID": "d4ChlEyALfRINShzrZhjJw", "Overall": "2", "Content": "Wanted: atmosphere, good wine and decent food for Sunday -early dinner. Received: expensive place, mediocre wine and salty, processed food in a place that looked like it had seen better days.  I will start out and say we had the nicest staff! No complaints at all on our service! I feel bad that they have to serve this food in this place and try to do it with a smile. I don't think I could (and I have worked food for years)  We called on the off chance Chianti's would be open on a Sunday- and they were (though they will be closing Sun and Mon for  the season  starting next week. I didn't realize there was a season for eating....but we decided to try it  based on the reviews.  We enter, and it is dark and empty  Greeted and seated by lovely Mary who explained it was happy hour and gave us a moment to look over the menus. I had a few questions, ordered a glass of their house cab and my partner ordered chianti on her suggestion. We also ordered the Mozzerella Fritta.  The wine came and the cab was so sweet it tasted like fortified wine. I questioned the bartendress (also lovely) and she tried it and said yes, it was sweeter than normal, would I like something else? I ended up with my bf's chianti (which wasn't amazing, but definitely better). The Fritta came and it was essentially two very large triangles of breaded, frozen moz that were barely cooked through, VERY salty and had chunky tomato sauce on them. Edible, but not fresh.  After looking through the menu and  a few more questions, (Only the Lobster Ravioli are handmade (why not the cheese?)  I decided on the manicoti (which I was told was prepared there) in bechemel sauce with fresh spinach and my bf got the orange roughy special (artichoke hearts, capers and sun dried tomatoes).  We asked about how busy the place was, (Friday night is hopping apparently!) and who the main clientele is (Older people from Sun City) but they get a mix. We were told it dies down in the Summer, which is why they were closing Sun/Mon.  I have now run out of wine, and so started looking through the dirty menus (all four of them were stuck with old food) to select another. I chose a 9/glass McManis cab- and after searching for it- two other opened bottle were brought out because they were  in the process of drastically cutting down the list . Neither were great and both had been open at least a day and recorked. I asked them how long each had been open and was told no more than a day on one and 2 at the MOST on the second bottle. If you are going to have wine open at all for more than a day-  vacuum seal it.  Plates come and are as hot as Mary tells us they would be (which means mine has been sitting under some heat lamp for awhile after being microwaved).  The plates look ok- I can do without all the parsley garnish on EVERY plate- but whatever.  The manicoti does have fresh spinach on top, but it is not in a bechemel sauce- it tastes like a who jar of Ragu Alfredo was poured over 3 frozen manicoti and nuked for 4-5 minutes. I understand you have to make things ahead and heat them up sometimes- but at least bake the items! No fresh cheese bubbling- only a thin layer of film from having sat for a minute too long under the lamps while the fish was cooked. Speaking of the fish- it wasn't bad. Not amazing, and kinda fishy smelling- but edible and nicely presented. Like everything, it was salty and plenty of frozen items were used to concoct it- but edible.  There are now 2 other tables, one of which came just after us and they heard the same thing we did - Fridays are hopping, the chianti is great and Mary recommends the lobster ravioli (at $22, I can see why). The next table is much more interesting.....having driven all the way across town to be here (really?) but then I hear why. Our bartender's martinis are among the best in town- and probably what we should have ordered to wash the rest of our meal down with! Doh!  End of meal comes- leftovers wrapped  and my bf now wants an espresso or capp.- do they have amachine? Yes. He asks- will I hear the milk froth? No- it comes in a  pod . He gets espresso anyhow. No bueno, and has 3 sugars in the espresso cup to just gulp it down. For $3?   We could not be tempted with the  Homemade Tiramisu  so sat and finished our wine while pondering the place.  Our conclusion is that Chianti Cafe needs to contact Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares and get a facelift. There is NO REASON why this place couldn't make it, but there is a WHOLE list of things that need to change. You can tell the owners are feeling the pinch, so have cut as many corners as they can. Sad really- LV doesn't have enough of these small, community spots. Despite the nice staff, we will not go back (but will check out the new Chronic Tacos that opened next door!) As for giving Nora's a run? Not a chance! Even at their worst- they use fresh food and have properly stored wine. We are disappointed, but know where to go for a martini!", "Date": "2010-05-24", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Duncan", "ReviewID": "ICb5MZmWR5r0jTCRXdg0SQ", "Overall": "4", "Content": "My wife and I went to Chianti for our anniversary.  And, we had a 20% off coupon.  We started with the garlic bread and as an appy ordered the cheesy artichoke dip (Carciofi Gratinati).  Both were wonderful, as were the drinks on the specials menu.  For our entrees, we ordered the Margherita pizza and the eggplant parm (Melanzane Alla Parmigiana).  The pizza was.....OK, nothing to write home about, but the eggplant parm was absolutely perfect, with the accompanying pasta served perfectly al dente.  We mentioned to the excellently attentive waiter that it was our anniversary, and he brought out a huge slice of tiramisu for our dessert, without our asking for it, and without charging us for it!  And when he brought out the check, we noticed he'd taken the 20% off the entire meal, including alcohol.  Doesn't get any better than that.  Now if they could only make the pizza a little more enticing, they'd earn five stars.", "Date": "2008-08-13", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "jillian", "ReviewID": "46cRGx-2ApELBK-N6UUZuA", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Chianti cafe is not a place worth going out of your way for, but if in the area you can get a better than average lunch at a reasonable price. In fact, they publicize their lunch menu as  everything under $10,  so you're pretty much forced to be frugal. If you have been there before, I'd like to let you know it has recently changed management. Apparently the restaurant was going downhill before they did, so if you had a bad experience you might want to try it again.  My Greca salad ($7.95) was quite enjoyable, and a touch unique. It was tossed with a creamy garlic dressing rather than a vinaigrette, which was a nice change, and the feta cheese was not of your standard supermarket variety. This cheese was soft and mild, without much salt. Though I personally prefer feta with a little more tang,  this was of good quality nonetheless and you do get some brininess from the kalamata olives.  My husband had the pastrami sandwich ($9.95) which was tasty but not delivered as promised. Instead of fries it came with a good version of basil mashed potatoes (I still would have preferred fries) and instead of the more appropriate rye bread listed in the description it was served on a soft hoagie. Additionally, the presentation was pretty sloppy as mustard was EVERYWHERE around the outside. There was too much mustard inside the sandwich as well, and it would have benefited from the use of whole grain or deli mustard rather than yellow. I still liked it as the pastrami itself was tender and delicious, but with a little improvement it would have been great.  Overall, it was a good lunch at a reasonable price, but not a real find by any means. I've had their pasta, which is fine, but not great, and the menu is fairly mainstream. It's just your average neighborhood Italian eatery in a nice area.", "Date": "2010-04-23", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Britney", "ReviewID": "cmHrMWRc9bLCGpwBO598qA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "I like Chianti, the outdoor seating area is nice during the spring and fall, while the inside typifies an average Las Vegas dinner spot. The staff is attentive. Entrees are tasty, I liked the beef carpaccio appetizer, as well as the nice, simple pasta dishes and pizzas, and the cioppino is (surprisingly) pretty good too (although the tomato broth is a little overwhelming and the seafood is obviously not coastal fresh). The bread/crostini is horrible (ala white Wonder Bread). Decent wine list, but less than helpful staff in that regard. Overall, I would recommend this spot to anyone stranded in Vegas and craving a bowl of cioppino (p.s., if you know of a better spot for cioppino in Vegas please let me know).", "Date": "2008-01-28", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Tommy", "ReviewID": "jis9W0FbZeIf_M0E1Vz4-w", "Overall": "2", "Content": "My girlfriend loves one of the lounge singers here, so I met a friend for dinner one rainy evening.

The lounge singer kept coming to our table & singing when we were obviously deep in conversation.  The first time we were polite & clapped when he walked away, but the second time & third time it was so loud my ears hurt.  He asked when finished if it was too loud and I said  a bit .  He seemed offended and I said  you asked .  The food was OK and we will not be coming back.", "Date": "2010-09-12", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
