She never did and we kept staring at her, but she wouldn't seat us.  Finally, we got up waited in line and she gave us a table!  I ordered the nachos and the veggie burger.

Yes please. Walked the strip for the first time in who knows how long and ended up at NY NY so some peeps could ride the roller coaster. As I was aimlessly walking around I remembered that there was a donut spot at NYNY I heard about and they had cronuts. Staff - one of them was clueless but luckily another came and rescued her. How hard of a question is,  which donut do I need to try?  You should have a favorite and if you don't you should have one that you can pretend is your favorite to answer questions just like that. I pretty much knew I was going to try a cronut but thought it was worth asking in case she was like  OMG you have to try this one.  Cronut - this looked more like the original cronut than the one i had at PB Doughnuts. It was really good. I thoroughly enjoyed it but it still felt like it was missing something. I guess I'll never know until I try the original. Maybe this was a dead ringer but in that case I would wonder what the craze was all about.

You see, when it comes to eating the day after a long night of drinking, there's not much you can do to fuck it up.  Unless of course you're  dining   at New York, New York's very own bland-a-tron.  America, is a veritable cornucopia of bad food, cheesy decor and, get this, surprisingly good service.  Yeah, go figure.   There were 8 of us eating and the majority of us all had something to say about the pathetic dishes that were brought out.  My BLT looked like it was made with bread from the local 99 cent store.  My friend Ian, who also ordered the BLT and fries, received 7 french fries on his plate.  Yes, 7.  Needless to say, we complained and got the rest of the missing fries to join his sandwich.  While the collective moans and groans at the table regarding the food were many, I found our waitress, Sigi, to be on top of her game.  It was almost as though she had a sixth sense regarding everything at the table.  Whether it was when we were placing the order or needing a refill, there she was, Joanna on the spot.  But , regardless of how good Sigi was, service only gets you so far.  So, when you're taking a break between between betting on black and rolling those dice, think twice about getting something to eat at America...it's a definite gamble.

Needing a breakfast fix, wifey and I strolled up, after noticing that the room was at least 3/4 empty.   Figuring that this place was a safe bet, we sat down for a quick bite. Shortly after we were seated, we saw that the NBA finals were on, but with no sound, and he big 'ol closed caption lines over the scoreboard.  So, we asked the waiter upon taking our orders to make them to go - we would be watching the game in our room.  Our order - breakfast burrito and pancakes - took 25 goddam minutes. Even after the wait, being in generally good spirits, we were only mildly annoyed. All we had to do now was pay the bill and get out.  However, that sentiment quickly turned, considering that after we received the food, our waiter didn't come back with the check.   5 minutes pass... As I'm getting up to walk out with my free food, my wife grabs what appeared to be a manager, and asked him for our check. He brings the check, we provide our card, and he, too, decides not to come back. WTF?  I ended up walking the check to the front so the manager could complete the transaction... then guess who decides to show up? The stupid goddam waiter! How've ya been, bud?  He approaches me as I'm walking back to our table and says,  Is everything okay?   No, prick. I'm missing the finals.  To wrap it all up, the meal we had in our room was indicative on the  wish it were mediocre  service. Dry breakfast burrito, and pancakes that were crispy like waffles on the edges.

You're a 15.00+ cab ride away from your hotel down the strip and you have no cash, your friends are borderline vomits, you're wearing a $500 dress that's sopping wet from a naked hot tub party that seems like a distant memory (wait, naked? how was my dress wet?) and the only thing that's going to keep you alive is a cup of coffee and some buttered toast. Where do you go? You go to America, the only restaurant that will cater to your busted, drunk ass.   We ordered sausage, eggs and toast, a pot of coffee, chicken fingers and nachos. Someway or another, the grand total of the bill was $60, not  including tip. This is for crap I probably could have bought at 7-11 for $10.00 or less for the same quality. I guess when you're drunk and rambling, you have to pay extra for someone to try to decipher the shit coming out of your mouth.   The service here is terrible. It's because the people who work here hate their lives and it's evident in their lack of facial expression. Some may be suicidal, I mean, if I was working there at 4 am trying to talk to drunk people who have no idea what they're doing or saying, I'd probably think off-ing myself would be a good idea, too.   The only thing worth mentioning is that fucking gigantic map of the US. I've been to America a bunch of times, the most recent time being the basis of my review - but that shit is funny when you're sober, when you're drunk, when you're high, and I'm sure if I ever did shrooms or any sort of hallucinogen, I would want to come here and just stare at it.   So what I'm trying to say is, don't come here for the food - you come here when you've hit rock bottom with your partying and you need to chill the fuck out with some really greasy, crappy food.

There's a huge 3D map of the US with different landmarks, which I thought was pretty cool to look at.  I was definitely hungry so I ordered some spicy wings. The wings were a little too bready for me and they had a weird after taste. Not great.  The husband ordered the brownie sundae which was ginormous! 'Murica! The vanilla ice cream tasted like some generic drug store brand, which was off putting. You know how sometimes you don't eat ice cream out of the carton for a long time and there's that thick chewy bit at the top? That's what it tasted like.

The next day I ordered the same thing and the fruit looked markedly different--wilted, definitely not as fresh and the cottage cheese tasted  off .  I wouldn't waste my time ordering coffee here, so I got a latte made at Il Fornaio next door.

We arrived around 7:30 AM and there wasn't much of a line.  So, I'm sure we'll be back one day for some real food.   As for my review...it's all about their donuts. I tried their maple bar with chocolate drizzle and some of their cronuts.  The maple bar wasn't as good as it looks.  The donut wasn't fresh, it was lacking any flavor, and for about $3, way to expensive.  However, I think America's has some of best cronuts that I've had in Las Vegas. I have my favorite out there, but America had a unique taste to their's.  Their cronuts were layered with the outside of each layer having a crunchiness to them.  It was moist inside each layer and as you get closer to the center of this hybrid donut, it's even softer.  There's a uniquie citrus taste to these cronuts which appeals to me.  America may have bad maple bars, but sure made a huge comeback with delicious cronuts.

Put it this way, they practically started clearing the table before I was through with my fruit bowl.  So much so that, when I lifted my arm to take a serving of fruit from the bowl, that by time my fork hit the dish, they had wisked away the fruit bowl and my fork ended up scooping air from the table.  After receiving the check, they immediately took the canteen of coffee away.  I guess that was our cue to leave.  On the way out, with our check in hand and headed to the register, we decided to admire the globe on the ceiling (which was the restaurant main feature and what drew us in).

I would have never known about this place had it not been for a birthday dinner party for friends staying at NYNY. My friend and I split 2 meals, 4 cheese pizza and rueben wrap.

I could tell just by the look of it that it was not going to be good but then I took a bite. Cold, chewy spongy soft dough, the only thing fresh on the pizza was the parsley. I'm not exaggerating it was the worst meal, I'd rather have a happy meal at McDonalds! The Rueben wrap wasn't much better, rubbery fatty meat, smothered in sauce.

Not to mention that in Vegas 24 hour spots are required knowledge. I've been twice and in both experiences the waitresses were excellent and patient.  Bonus:This cafe serves alcohol!  THE BAD: American food can be found a little cheaper elsewhere.  It's in a Hotel Casino and that may not suit all families. This also means you can't park out front so you'll have to walk from the hotel parking structure waaaay out back. They allow smoking indoors in Las Vegas. (I guess for some that could be good or bad).  ALL IN ALL:  I rated this place with 5 stars because to me it is the ultimate cafe in Vegas.

I noticed many of the unhappy Yelpers  complained about the breakfast service and food, so that may be why our experience was much better since we went during dinner on a weekday night.  Our server was Tha and he was very professional and made sure we were taken care of.  They had a kids menu complete with crayons which made our son very happy.  He brought out juice in a kids cup also which was a plus since we were inside a casino and have not found many places that catered to children during this trip.  The large 2-D map on the ceiling captured his interest for a long while too.  We ordered the kids cheeseburger and fries for our son, which came on a wheat bun and served with potato wedges.  The bf ordered a patty melt and fries.  I had the catch of the day, very fresh grilled salmon in a chili glaze with seasoned rice and fresh sauteed vegetables.  I was hungry and the portion was a bit small, so a cup of soup or salad included probably would have satisfied me.  The cousins ordered nachos and the steak and crab leg special which they did enjoy.  We were able to catch up with each other for over 2 hours without feeling rushed.  This is one of the few places we will return to when wanting to eat at a restaurant inside any casino.  The food is decently priced, fresh, and tastes decent.  When we used our comp to pay for our bill, Tha never bristled like a few of the servers at the other places did.  Since he provided excellent service, he received a large tip.  That is what servers need to realize, even though the meal is comped, if you provide good service, most people will still tip you, and leave much more than usual since they did not have to pay for the meal.

I had the Prime Burger, which is a Half pound ground prime rib, Swiss cheese, red onion marmalade, demi glace and horseradish aïoli served with french fries. Everything tasted great and I had really no complaints.   The place is huge, but never got crowded. They have a cool map of the United States hanging above. It's like a 3D in your face map, so something cool to look at, or entertain your kids with as this would be a great place to dine with your family.  The menu is not overwhelming. There are times you hope the menu has so much stuff it overwhelms, then we complain. Then when it doesn't you have that feeling to still complain and wonder,  thats it?  There are plenty of selections, from salads, to soups, sandwhiches, entrees, etc. **YELP TIP** CHECK OUT THEIR WEBSITE FOR THE MENUS  There is a nice simple bar within the restaurant entrance if you want to get your drank on without being in a crowded place. It's INSIDE the NY NY, so you do have to go through the casino, but it is simple to find.   Would I eat here again? Sure! However, would I actually go here again? Only if I had to.  BTW, Great staff.

Except in our case it wasn't howling but it was the incessant sound of clinging coins, and it wasn't a snowstorm but utter mayhem on the Casino floor.   Lastly, it wasn't icy but it was an inconceivable amount of cheap booze that would leave us clutching ourselves in agony the next morning.  While the food pretty much sucked at America, I'm still pretty fucking glad the place was still open at 3 AM on Sunday morning.  While my wife ordered the steak the first night, she opted for the pancakes the second night.   I went with the Macaroni & Cheese and a Spicy Chicken Sandwich the first night and the Macaroni & Cheese and Potato Skins the second night.    (Hey! Nothing like simple carbs to absorb an insane amount of alcohol lounging about in your stomach)  The first night, the Mac & Cheese tasted very much like I what I imagine a Salt Lick tastes like.   The Spicy Chicken Sandwich was anything but.  I'm guessing they ran out of Buffalo sauce and they figured I was too drunk to give a fuck.   While it's true I was too drunk to start an argument then & there, I knew I'd get these fuckers on Yelp sooner or later.    The Mac & Cheese the 2nd night was legit... not great but certainly better than the first night since I could actually glimpse the taste of cheese that time around.   My wife said the steak was completely fucked up and she's still having painful bowel movements some 48 hours later.   The pancakes were good, but then again how does one really fuck up pancakes now, right?  If this was the Bay Area, I'd probably give this place 1 star or 2 at the very most.   Seeing as they're open 24 hours a day though, I'm being generous and giving them 3 stars.   Besides, as drunk as we were, it's fascinating to realize that you're the most composed couple at 3 AM in here.   I feel bad for the waiters and waitresses here... They gotta deal with some seriously fucked up shit every day.", "Date": "2010-01-11", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Cheri", "ReviewID": "TQosQeeDMMhRke4lvBaCBw", "Overall": "3", "Content": "We stayed at the NY NY and just decided to eat here one night.

Hubby had a king club, he said it was good, not wonderful.  I had a stir fry chicken salad.  It tasted good but was the oddest salad.  I think the lettuce must have walked by the dish and a few leaves jumped in because it was primarily cold noodles, shrimp, the menu said there were veggies in it, couldn't find any and topped with fried rice noodles.

So 300.00 down the drain and down on our luck we are hungry... starving say the least... we walk around and find America.   We decide to sit at the bar ( some thing i rarely do).. watch some college football... and order up some grub. Rich comes over to take care of us.. and take care of us he does. Charming personality, and doesn't seem to get ruffled....   One thing my friend and I love to do is watch people tip. We watched him serve up things great time after time, and never flinch when gathering up his tips.. be it the 50 cent change or 2.00 for a 3.00 beverage.. he smiled, checked on his entire client group ... along the bar... often.   I like this place, good bar set up, nice sizable dining area.. and a great big map of the USA, with little symbols on each state.. probably a great place to take you kids.. should you have had to bring them to Vegas... and get a little education out of it.   The price is the price... what you would expect from a Vegas Restaurant... 2 bud light drafts, 1 Pepsi, 2 chicken sandwiches .. and edamame... oh yeah, and the food we extremely satisfying...

Each time we went the place wasn't very busy, but the service was pretty slow. Even so, all of our servers were very friendly and attentive.  We had the following dishes:  Humongous Pretzel - This pretzel really is humongous. It could serve 2-3 people and came with French's Mustard and Cheddar Cheese Sauce. It was what you would expect any soft pretzel to be: soft and chewy and delicious.    Petite Caesar Salad - While it maybe  petite  it really was a generous serving. The house made croutons were huge (and my toddler loved chewing on them), and it was pretty tasty.  ABC Omelet and the Ham & Cheese Omelet - Pretty good. Generous amount of avocado on the ABC omelet, and lots of ham in the Ham & Cheese omelet. I thought it was interesting that the cheese wasn't inside the omelet, but rather melted on top. Both came with hash browns and choice of toast, and a delicious mini muffin.  Steak and Eggs - Steak was a bit under cooked, but the rest was good.   Corned Beef Hash & Eggs - A little greasy and kind of a small portion,but good nonetheless.   America is careful to prevent cross contamination if you have a gluten intolerance, which we really appreciated. They have several options that are GF and took the time to make sure everything came out as it should. The prices here were pretty decent, too.

The sandwich was served cold which was fine with me. But it tasted very strongly of horseradish to the point where the store bought roast beef and veggies were sort of overpowered. That was also fine. I thought it'd at least make the sandwich taste like SOMETHING, but not to long into my meal and I felt a strange gagging reflex and a rumbling in my tummy. The meat seemed to have gone bad and it was very well masked by the aforementioned horseradish. I spent the night with an upset stomach and a bit of heaving.

I had breakfast one morning at the cafe, and service was very quick.  I ordered the bagel sandwich, which has eggs, bacon, ham, and cheddar cheese.  It comes with hash browns.  The only hot sauce America has is red Tabasco, which I don't care for by itself.  So, the waiter asked if I would like to try their salsa.  I said I would.  The salsa wasn't bad, it actually had a little spice.  It's thin, so it was hard to get on the sandwich, I basically had to dip.  I was annoyed when the bill arrived and I had a $1.50 charge for the salsa.  It's not that I care about paying $1.50, but he offered like he was doing me a favor and didn't mention it was an additional charge.  I would have still said yes, but I feel like you should give diners a heads up when there is a charge that's not on the menu directly in front of them.  The sandwich was large and did not stay together well.  The bagel was grilled, but not toasted.  I would have preferred it toasted for a more consistent result.  The shaved ham overwhelmed the sandwich, which is too bad because the bites I did get with bacon were very good.  The hash browns had a decent sear to them, they clearly were cooked well.    It's not fantastic, but a decent value if you are in need of a quick and casual meal.

My food was so bad and the eggs were so runny, that I had to send them back.  And I never send food back because I feel bad.... Anyhow, I sent it back (after waiting forever to get the waiter's attention and instead I got the manager's attention). My food came back a second time partially cooked more, but still runny.  I hate the runny white part in eggs over medium.  It was pretty gross.  I couldn't eat it and was starving by then, so I just ate the toast and bacon. My toast was ice cold.  The butter wouldn't even melt on it. I was told there wasn't any creamer for the coffee, and instead they brought me a cup with milk in it.  I ended up not drinking my coffee at all.  I was ready to rip this place apart....  Then I asked the waiter for the bill since he didn't seem to get the hint that I had been sitting there forever waiting for it.

Prices for dinner are ridiculous and the food quality is terrible. They get away with it because they are located in the N.Y. N.Y. Hotel and can charge high prices for low end food.  My friend and I had dinner there recently, I had the flat iron steak and my friend had the shrimp scampi dinner. It wasn't that impressive looking at it in the dish but we thought it tasted OK not great but OK.  Service was terrible, our waitress took the order and then never checked back to see if the food was to our liking. We had to call the manager for a minor problem. We saw the waitress when it was check time.  I tasted his food and he had some of mine and we agreed it wasn't worth the price.  When we left the restaurant we both got such tummy aches we had to literally RUN TO THE NEAREST RESTROOM, and everything we just ate immediately left our body. (need I say more). Apparently the food wasn't handled properly.  After we came back from the restroom we both felt fine.  I called the restaurant and complained and also filled out a report (why) I didn't say I had food poisoning, but this was their  practice, to cover themselves just in case.  I emailed the corporate office about our experience and received a phone call from their VP whose name was Paul and he told me  it was baloney  I couldn't possibly have gotten sick that quickly from their food.  His manners on the phone were horrible, very loud and didn't listen to what I was telling him.  Basically he said I couldn't have gotten sick from their food and I told him unless he ate the food out of my dish he shouldn't say that.  He wasn't there watching it being prepared nor did he eat it.  Since  we both had stomach aches and rushed to the restroom after leaving the America Restaurant  it was because of the improper handling of the food.  I expected an apology but what I got was a yapping Vice President who of course believes that the America restaurant is perfect.  Nothing is perfect and if a customer complains about a problem I would think good customer service would be to apologize for a terrible dining experience.  Not so here.

The only real reason I gave this four rather than five stars, was that our server disappeared for what seemed like ten minutes before we could pay our bill. Not a deal breaker, but a nuisance nonetheless.  Anyway if you're in NYNY and want some breakfast, it's worth a shot. Not to mention if you don't care about having eggs and hashbrowns etc. They have a great deal for all you can eat pancakes at like $6 (which were fluffy and delicious).

We were seated fairly quickly after a 10-minute wait. This place is huge and it was fairly empty at this time. The map of the US hanging from the ceiling is a nice touch and very educational.  Almost everyone in our group got the $12 rib-eye steak midnight special. My steak was delicious! and cooked to my liking. Although I had asked for my steak to be cooked medium, my gf noted that it wasn't medium and that it was missing the little plastic thing they stick on the meat to show how well it was cooked.  Medium or not, I still enjoyed it. Must be my hunger taking over. I've also never heard of HP brand steak sauce until I came here. I usually pour A1 on my steak but after trying the HP sauce, I'm a convert! It had more zing and brought out the taste of the steak to the fullest.  We had a lava cake for dessert but I didn't like the ice cream that came with it. Toffee/coffee flavored. I prefer chocolate or vanilla next to my lava cake.  My only complaint was that I had ordered my steak with mash potatoes but instead it came with baked potato. I liked the baked potato enough so I didn't bother to have it exchanged. Also, I had to flag down the waiter a few times to remind him to bring/refill my gf's iced tea. He keeps on forgetting. I guess I can't blame him for serving a huge group on a graveyard shift.

You will waste your money. This place is dreadful. My mom and I decided to eat here because we were staying at New York New York and we didn't want to walk the strip for breakfast and this was within the Hotel. We chose it because it was a traditional American breakfast and we were craving pancakes and french toast. Upon walking up the hostess was very rude. I asked if we could sit on the edge and not in the middle of the room, because we wanted a quieter spot than being smack in the middle of everyone. The hostess was rude and told us only one table was open and it was one in the middle. We sat and a few minutes later, low and behold, they started seating people on the edge, after I was told we couldn't have a table in those areas. Next, I ordered the croissant french toast. It was awful. Cold, hard, I couldn't even cut it with a fork. The french toast also had no flavor, very bland. My mom had the regular french toast, and her food was also pretty bad. Cold, no flavor and looked like her bread was smashed. It was so dreadful I called over a manager. The manager was a very nice lady. She apologized and comped our meal. The manager offered me to choose something different on the menu, but I honestly was so turned off by the whole experience I didn't even want to try anything else they had on their menu. The manager was nice and so was our waiter, other than that there is nothing good I can say about this place. Honestly, as a person who loves breakfast this is an honest review. I do not want people to waste their money here. There are so many yummy places to eat in Vegas, and the whole point of Vegas is to splurge and have fun.

My sister had the cedar plank salmon, and it was perfectly cooked.  My friend had a salad with tuna, and she liked it.  My other friend devoured her cheeseburger in a matter of seconds, and had quite the smile on her face.  The four of us shared the hot-fudge brownie sundae for dessert.  Seriously THE BEST hot fudge brownie sundae I have ever tasted.  The brownie was moist, soft, chewy, with just a few nuts.  The fudge was thick and rich.  This sundae was AMAZING.  Just remember that the bottom of the ice cream dish is coated with hot fudge, so don't ignore the bottom of the bowl!  I can't say enough about our waiter.  Rich is my newest crush.

His hashbrowns were a little better than mine but still, way over done and dry.  My daughter got the Red Velvet Pancakes and barely ate 1/3 of them!

In the 4 days i went, i had Steak and Eggs, A bagel with lox, omelet with lox and 2 eggs sunny side with bacon.  In general all was well above par and blows any Denny's or IHOP out of the water.   The steak n eggs was about $15 and tasted better then many  dinner  steaks I've had in chain restaurants. The bagel with lox was a tad overpriced at near $11, but was delicious. The omelet with lox was good, but the lox were cooked. I sort of expected it on the side (idk why). it just tasted like a fish omelet to me. Strange but good.

This is the 24 hour behemoth inside New York New York.  These 24 hour diner style establishments I review as if I am forever comparing them to a Denny's.  When I arrived at America I was seated quickly and brought water and coffee quickly, which in Vegas is a great way to start any meal.  Big old carafe of weak coffee is plopped down on your table within a minute of sitting down, and although it isn't the finest quality it makes up for it in quantity.  They have this giant tilted sculpted map of America that hangs precariously over your head as you eat.  I was seated under Texas and this did not make me happy, but examining the map/art thing was a great way to pass the time until my food arrived.  The service was quick and prompt, although the waiter forgot my smoothie on the first trip but realized it himself and was back super quick with it.  My breakfast plater thing had a good amount of mediocre food, that looked like it had actual veggies in it.  Weird.  Also the bacon had some sort of thickness (it was NOT thick bacon), but when you compare it to the bacon at a Denny's it was pretty divine.  I am pretty sure they had some kind of all you can eat buttermilk pancakes for a pretty good price as a special, but a lot of basic pancakes just didn't special to me.  I overheard that this is the food that they serve as room service in New York New York, so hopefully that helps. Things I like : Decor, Lots of coffee, bacon, hash browns, service Things I dislike: Smoothie (tasted watered down and also pricey) in the end these 24 hour places with decent prices are how I usually survive in Vegas for at least part of my time there, and I would return to America when I am dangerously close to extinction.", "Date": "2010-09-23", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Nathan", "ReviewID": "K5_kOX8G2DJt4qHIVUUsJA", "Overall": "3", "Content": "We rolled into America at close to 4 a.m. hungry after a night of gambling and drinking.

Our friendly server made a few suggestions from the menu, none of them appealed to either of us. We each just wanted something simple, we weren't looking for or expecting a fine dining experience. A nice, juicy hamburger with fries would do the trick.  The orders came out promptly and looked delicious. The fries were hot and crispy but something was definitely not right with the hamburgers. The texture was odd, they had no flavor and after peeling back the bun, no grill marks to show they had ever touched a grill or flat top. I'm 99% certain they were precooked, (maybe even purchased frozen and pre cooked?) then heated in a microwave. The bun LOOKED great but, while not stale, had obviously been around a day or two. We each left 2/3 of our burgers untouched. Paid the bill and left.  Possibly they had an off night, but a decent hamburger isn't hard to do is it?

I was very disappointed with my experience at America. During long layover I'm Vegas I decided to go on the strip for a few hours. I needed to start with breakfast. I passed up 48TH and Crepes because the line was really long and there was no where to sit. My weariness led me to make the bad choice of choosing America.  I knew going on the food was overpriced for what they were serving but i was really tired after flight. I ordered the Chicken and Waffles and after waiting 20 min for my order, even though the place was slow, I saw my food and knew right away I was going to regret choosing this place. It came with 3 pieces of chicken which could have came fron a chick they were so tiny. I could tell the chicken was bought prepared and heated up. It had that familiar orangey color diner chicken has where the establishment is too lazy to flour chicken themselves. Lots of places actually serve this chicken and it's not bad tasting but it can easily be dry. Of course those tiny pieces were far from moist. The Waffles were crunchy on the outside and fluffy in the middle, nothing spectacular about the flavor. But my guess is that any place who doesn't take pride in preparing their own chicken, probably bought the waffle mix prepared as well. Funny that the restaurant is called America, pretty ironic. Lazy, no pride in your product, over charging customers, the buck you make is more important then the goods they are pedaling.  Is that what they are saying America is?   The service was great, that's the only reason I gave them a star.

I stopped by America on my way out of the NYNY for the day and grabbed a cup of Morning Blend coffee and a chocolate sprinkle donut .  The coffee was great but the donut.... Well, the donut wasn't fresh, like at all.  I wonder if the bake them the night before kinda fresh .  The donut was impressive in size and the $5 deal for coffee and a donut wasn't bad at all, but the donut was old and not flakey nor warm. I would stop in for a quick coffee again .", "Date": "2016-06-10", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Emilia", "ReviewID": "gyR2EQqJZECD0hWla--jNQ", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Overpriced omelet that was wayyy too eggy. OK, I get that an omelet is made of eggs... duh. But with an omelet, you have to have the right proportions of toppings to omelet, and in mine, there was just too much egg. Get this -- I paid $19 (service charge tacked on for 4 people eating, wtf) for a bad omelet, toast and potatoes!  Service was slow. He was slow to bring the check, and never brought my water.  The one thing America has going for it is convenience, with its location in NY NY.

It's reasonably priced breakfast for 2 for about $35.

They are fresh blended and not a mix from a machine. Hot wings are a great late night snack. I wish they would bring the medallion steak salad back. They have made some changes and I feel maybe they are trying too hard to be upscale. It's the America bar and grill after all so shredded celery with hot wings is a bit over the top.

America was running a rib-eye steak special for $14.95.  We were pleasantly surprised by not just the taste but the size as well.  Well worth the money compared to other places on the strip.  I highly recommend giving it a try.  Ask for Chris if you do.  His service was outstanding despite being busy.

I mean this was a pretty sweet deal especially when your luck is down.  (I was doing pretty good at the tables here)  Came here with my boys after spending hours at the tables.  They tried to get steak and eggs but for $13.99...ha no way.  I told them you might as well get the steak dinner and add eggs....overall you pay like a dollar more and you get a baked potato and veggies...I know I am so chinese.  The steak was not bad considering it was my 3rd one in a span of 24 hours....it was too big tho cuz I only ate half of it.

Starving from all the walking through the whole vegas strip.   Service: Food takes forever to arrive. Server was sweet though.  Ambiance: Interesting decor. There is a huge decor of America in middle of room. High ceiling and huge place. There is a bar area where you can watch sports.  Food: One of the better chicken noodle soups I had where its not super salty to cover up the lack of chicken broth flavor.  We wanted sweet potato fries and our server recommended the brisket fries. Taste just like bbq meat on fries thats all it is. Its not bad though just nothing to rave about either. There is also way too many fat pieces on the meat i had to dig out.
