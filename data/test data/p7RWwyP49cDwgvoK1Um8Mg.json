I really love this place for breakfast. I'd give it 5 stars but I had a weird experience last Saturday. I ordered a strawberry Belgian waffle and a kids chocolate chip pancake. (Hey, be nice, I couldn't decide what I wanted and Mom said to get both so who am I to argue?) The waitress asked if I wanted whipped cream. Yes, I said, on both. She brought out the food but nothing had whipped cream on it. She realized and brought me a large side of it but it wasn't the same. The heat of the breads is supposed to melt it a little bit and make it moist but these were *seriously* dry. The strawberries were yummy but  dry  as well (which is fine-- they're not supposed to be wet-- but it didn't help the dry waffle/pancake problem.) It was a little weird smearing the cream on after the fact, but whatever.   The ham and cheese omelette my mom got was fantastic, as was the orange juice.

On the weekend the lines were so long it was like waiting for a concert.  Then they moved to the old cafe space in the back of the casino. Much more space. And it started tanking. They brought in a lot of new faces. The food went down almost immediately, the serving sizes shrank, the flavors changed,  the staff were clueless, and worst of all the open area had smoke drifting in from the casino.

The restaurant feels cramped, with too many small tables in the open center of the room. A woman seated at the table behind mine banged her chair into mine by simply pulling it out to sit down. They seem to serve many families; the close seating must cause problems when kids get restless or fussy.  The food my party ordered was slow to arrive and no longer hot when it was brought to us. Other diners seemed to have the same 20-minute wait for their dishes, so we couldn't write this off as just a fault of our server. I ordered the Challah French Toast and found it to be a little dry in the center. If I had to eat here again I would choose something else.

I went to this restaurant for a reunion with one of my old work mates from the now-defunct Tower Records. I decided to go along, feeling I needed to see these people I hadn't seen in years and try a new restaurant.  Let me start the review by saying I had absolutely no problem with the food here. Our party ordered a plethora of diverse item, and what I tried and saw was very good. The Belgian waffle that I ordered was superb.  But that's where the good stuff ends. Our food took an eternity to come out. I don't think I have ever waited this long to get my food, at ANY restaurant. For this alone, the staff should have discounted our meal, but no one stepped forward to do so.  And it only gets worse! The 6 of us all had different ways of paying (some credit/debit cards, some cash, etc.), and the staff REFUSED TO SPLIT THE BILL. I admit, we probably should have asked them to split the check earlier on, but when you're running a restaurant, you work with your customers and do what is right for them. This meant tons of money borrowing/lending/ATM trips just to pay it. Paying for our food should NEVER be a hassle like this. These jackasses are getting the SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY either way, so how hard would it have been to split the damn check?  My last complaint is that the restaurant has been moved from its original position. Originally it was right inside Green Valley Ranch, just inside of the north doors atop the parking garage. it has now been moved much deeper into the facility, meaning you're going to have a long smoke-filled trek to the restaurant through the casino just to get there.  Seriously, why eat at this place when you can avoid the annoying trek through the parking garage and casino, and just go eat at Denny's or IHOP? The food is about the same quality either way, and I have never had these issues at either of the other chains. So go elsewhere to have your pancake needs filled.

They charged us around $9 for this omelette. I'll happily pay that much for an omelette at the original OPH in Portland, because they are delicious and have more eggs than cheese.

My daughter got the lasagna which she liked, I tried it and thought it was good as well. The restaurant itself is very upscale looking and has flat screen TVs and I think ESPN was on, as far as ambience goes it blows IHOP out of the water. As far as the menu goes it wasn't very extensive compared to IHOP, the complete dining experience (service/food/atmosphere) is good enough to recommend OPH. I actually was least impressed with their pancakes, they were okay but quite small, with a name like OPH I expected some big honkin flapjacks like I've seen on Food Networks  Man vs Food  or  Diners, Drive Ins and Dives .

The pancakes here have gotten thinner and not as fluffy as they were a couple years back.    The dutch baby is always a winner, but isn't quite filling enough for me on its own.

I really loved their chocolate chip pancakes!!! The chips are slightly warm and oh so smearable on your pancakes. scooped some of the side whip cream and  tossed it on my pancake, took the first bite and I was in pancake heaven. no need for syrup... it was delicious just with the  melted chocolate chips n whip cream.  she checked up on us a couple of times...I always appreciate that and not afraid to give a larger tip when that happens.

He loves them though, as much as I wish he would not order them.  I usually order an omelet, as they are baked and light and fluffy.  However, someone needs to tell the cooks to stop putting so much cheese on them, as it overwhelms the flavor of the omelet.  The first time I ate here I ordered the spinach omelet with cheddar, and there was so much cheese that the grease was dripping all over the plate.  The second time, I ordered the veggie omelet and got the gouda cheese, thinking it wouldn't be as greasy.  It wasn't greasy but there was so much cheese I couldn't taste the egg at all in the dish. I'd still order it again, just with no cheese.

They also have your other breakfast favorites like waffles, omletes, bacon, etc.   Their omletes are HUGE and very fluffy since they're oven baked. I've tried almost all of them and they're all equally delicious. They also come with a side of pancakes so it's good pick!  Potato Pancakes: basically hash browns in a pancake form. Comes with apple sauce. This dish is a little too greasy for me, but the pancakes are crispy and the apple sauce helps counter act some of the greasiness.   Eggs Michael: pretty much eggs benedict except with their mushroom sauce which is basically a creamy mushroom sauce that reminds me of cream of mushroom soup. Not bad.

We ventured off to Green Valley Ranch for some pancakes and eggs at the Original Pancake House.   It was close to closing time and though I generally despise doing that to the wait staff, my craving for sweet and delicious pancakes overrode my general rule of thumb on this occasion.   The Station Casinos cafe converted into the Pancake House seemed to be a smooth transition. Seated in a comfy booth the service was timely.   Let's talk food, pancakes were comparable to my usual pick, IHOP and the eggs, eh, they were your usual scrambled deal, nothing special. The German potatoes or whatever they're calling them there (ya know, the carbs that accompany your breakfast?), they were seasoned nicely and I did not have a hard time clearing them off of my plate.   All in all, I am still perplexed by the cost of OJ! I understand there may be some additional labor involved in  fresh squeezed  juice, but $4 for a highball glass, really? Whatevs, that is my only real gripe with this fine establishment, that and the fact that the venue closes.   IT'S VEGAS PEOPLE, everything's 24-hours, that's the appeal, isn't it?! And GVR doesn't really have a 24-hour eatery happening anymore so why not leave the Pancake House open for all hungry sinners?
