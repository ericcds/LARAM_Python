Decided to eat with friends after watching Harry Potter.  Cana Latin Kitchen bar dishes are served just like Firefly restaurant, in small servings so one dish will not fill you up. It's set that way so you can have the opportunity to taste other things on the menu without getting full.  Stepping inside, the atmosphere was dark and intimate, a good place to take out a date to talk and drink wine together. The LCD tv at the center of the bar kind of ruins that mood a bit though. Monday night football was on and no one was really paying attention to it because everyone was involved in their own intimate private conversation and having one tv in this type of setup just doesn't blend in well.  Despite having only one server that night, she was very attentive to everyone inside. I'll give the service a good review. I ordered the mixto ceviche (shrimp, scallop and calimari). The tortilla came separate with it which were served in potato chips size pieces.  Taste was ok but thats because I prefer my ceviche with a heavy lime taste.  I also ordered the fish taco which came in 3 small pieces.  I tasted my friends tuna ceviche too which I recommend to anyone that comes here. It was the best dish we had on our table.  So if you're ever around town square at night and on a movie date, stop by this place after. Great way to end a night if you don't feel like partying in the neighboring bars and just in a mood to have a quiet place to eat and have a conversation.", "Date": "2010-11-23", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "EJay", "ReviewID": "fxqiH1JwuPbJ83uvRLbpiA", "Overall": "2", "Content": "Ambiance- This place is very nice, warm and cozy. The place is dimly lit which I  am personally comfortable with. The bar area is nice and the tables are spaced evenly throughout the restaurant.   Food- I came here the night before Easter Sunday. So, I was not able to try any of the meat dishes.  The food is a bit disappointing. After you have the tapas at Firefly, it is difficult  to match the quality, quantity and taste of the food.   Location-The location is great. Across from Blue Martini and steps away from the movie theaters. Town square is a great location.   Price- A bit on the steep side. You do not get enough bang for your buck. You cannot really expect much because of the expensive rent  these places have to pay at Town Square.   Service - It is OK, nothing special.

I have to say that this should be  the  spot of the summer (for drinks). It has a central location, Miami-ish décor, balcony that overlooks the Town Square park, and two additional balconies on both sides that are all perfect for people watching. Additionally, throw in the mojitos and tapas and we have the perfect summer spot.  However, there are a couple things they need to work on.  The servers were amazing. The bartenders were a little slow and unresponsive but seeing the work it takes to make a mojito, I understand.   What was strange was the managers that stood around and did nothing. No hi, no bye, nothing, just stood there taking up space. At first, I figured that maybe they were customers but later found out they were managers who just got in the way of the servers and the customers. It'd be better if they would of had personalities. Hopefully, that'll change as business increases.  The sangria was amazing ... and I don't even like sweet drinks. But the food was very subpar. It's nothing special and was very mediocre compared to a place like Firefly. As a matter of fact we ordered about ten different items on the menu and maybe the only thing that stood out was the mushroom ceviche and the dates with bacon (even though Firefly's is better but how do you mess up something with bacon wrapped around it anyway). Everything else was ... eh and will not have me running back there to eat. With places that have waaaaayyyy better food within walking distance (Johhny McGuire's, Yardhouse, Bar Louie, and even Cadillac Ranch) I'd rather eat somewhere else and afterwards go grab a couple drinks at night here.", "Date": "2010-03-07", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Kris", "ReviewID": "yTFgTpbsM5vUMmzhoEfBng", "Overall": "4", "Content": "I love Cana's mojitos which are muddled with fresh fruit and real sugar cane.

They market themselves as a ceviche place, and the ceviche is terrible.   This was my experience. I called in the afternoon to make a dinner reservation, and I was told I don't need one. Should've been a red flag. After much persistance, I convinced the host to just reserve me a table anyway. When I arrived, my party wasn't there yet, so I took my table because the bar was full. I wasn't offered a beverage for quite some time.   When my friends arrived, they received warm water with no ice in a sticky glass. My sangria took a very long time to make. We ordered 3 dishes after waiting quite some time for our waitress. After about 20 minutes, the waitress told us that the chef had just informed her they were out of salmon... We were starving! Did she wait 20 minutes to put in the order? People around us were getting food.   The first dish to arrive was mini chorizo corn dogs. Flavor was terrible, no spice at all. The texture was even worse. Next we received the item that we substituted for the salmon, which was a crab ceviche. Completely over salted, and was more like tuna than crab.   Finally our 3rd dish arrived, the hirame ceviche. When the waitress described it to us, she mentioned it was the special of the night which came with a salad. There was no salad. No greens. Nothing. This one was at least slightly tasty compared to the others, but it wasn't amazing. I contemplated dessert, but couldn't justify giving this establishment another cent.   I was very glad that some of the people I was planning to dine with couldn't make it. I would hate for them to suffer through this meal. It was awful. Service - poor, food - poor, drinks - poor.   I will say, however, that the place is decorated nicely. Wouldn't be bad to stop in for a beer before or after a movie. I just wouldn't eat. Not sure this place will stay open long, it was pretty empty when we went, and, in the words of the hostess, reservations aren't really needed.", "Date": "2010-02-13", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Guy", "ReviewID": "DaD9JQvurWdjMKTq5h4eMw", "Overall": "4", "Content": "A friend and I went to dinner here, and while the experience was brief, and the conversation was enjoyable and longer than the meal, I had a good time.  I didn't try much of their menu, save for their beef empenadas.  I found them to be tasty and well cooked.  Since I stuck with that, the pricing was respectable.  I had also tried their  Fire Water  drink based off the name alone, and I found it to be enjoyable as well.  A bit of a small glass, but the flavor was good.  I don't want to rate it any higher on the grounds that I only had one menu and drink selection, and they were more of a quick snack than a full meal, but my friend and I enjoyed our individual meal selections, and the overall vibe and view were pleasant.  Perhaps in returning at a later time, I'd be able to make a more concrete decision on where I want to place my enjoyment factor, but the first impression was pleasant enough to want to check it out again.", "Date": "2010-05-02", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Peter", "ReviewID": "6Q8FhcQQesh8if8IdPKF1A", "Overall": "5", "Content": "It was my first time trying ceviche so, it could be like Beatles, Sgt Peppers being your first album.  But if you do not love this place you are missing a key part of your  foodie  DNA. This restaurant is the answer to every time you've said  I wish I could try 5 plates .  Tapas is small plates of each. Needless to say, when I got back to NY, I looked up a ceviche place within 24 hours.  If you are going once I'd recommend trying the ceviche, piggy back dates in goat cheese mouse, shrimp in chicharran sauce, short ribs and save room for homemade churros or that chocolate kiss with sea salt and chipotle sauce (?!?!?)   - Hamachi ceviche - for those rookies like me....this is like sashimi/fish  cooked  in citrus by the acid. I've never had pickled hot peppers but its like sweet hot tangy awesomeness. (is it obvious I'm not a professional reviewer?)   Shrimp in chicharran sauce - crispy shrimp (they use 3 flours) with a little bit of pop.   Short ribs -- one large short rib in guava glaze. Its probably the best bbq sauce with rich, slightly tangy, but smooth flavor. The meat was fall off the bone tender.   Piggy back dates -- a must have. dates wrapped in bacon with an almond inside for some pop and then in a bed of white mousse. Come on!  I could eat these on the coach all day.  Best dish. A must have.   - Mojitos - I have to admit I didn't have but was with 10 people and the mixed drinks and variations on the mojito shocked people.  Not as sweet  as most.   Lastly, service was perfect as you'd expect the timing for each dish to be difficult.   I want to sit outside next time but it was packed so that wasn't possible but they seem to have the best view in town square.   Gun to my head I'd say I didn't like the chicken skewers but it turned out they were missing the rum glaze so that was the reason.   I think what I loved most was just the variations on every dish. Yes they have corn dogs but they have chorizo. Yes the have mac and cheese but its has habanero in it. Piggy back dates with almonds and white mousse? Can you picture what that taste like? There's something for everyone here. Ceviche, mac and cheese, shrimp, pickled jalapenos, bread pudding. Not joking this place reminded me of dishes at Nobu and as I said to a friend,  I'm not just saying this, but this might be the best meal I ever had  I felt like I was trying to find something I didn't find mindblowing to seem credible when I told friends about it. I was asking locals at the malls if they had been.

I know everyone on Yelp is obsessed with Firefly, but I can now confidently say I much prefer Cana! Before I get onto the main review, a few reasons why this place kicks Firefly's butt:  *Well crafted, DELICIOUS drinks. I know we all love those sugary mojitos at Firefly, but the flavorings are all just powders and artificial. The fruit mojitos here are muddled with real fresh fruit - they used a half pint of blueberries on one freaking mojito that I watched them make! I much prefer real fruit to powdered mixes, but to each his own.  *Service is exponentially better. The bartenders will actually take the time to get to know you and make sure you love your drink. My mojito gets thrown at me with no hello at FireFly  *Atmosphere. I love the sexy lounge/patio they have going! Happy hour is till 7, instead of ending at 6 PM like it does on FF on Paradise.   --------------------------  I've said it once and I'll say it again - the drinks are awesome and they are why I come here. The mojitos are muddled with fresh fruit, and they have some awesome martinis. I do have to give the edge to Firefly on the sangria, however. They only have one kind at Cana and it's just oK.  We've tried half the menu and love nearly everything we've tried. I think the low point is sadly  the ceviche. We tried their best selling yellowtail ceviche and while it was fresh, I don't like their funky new style. If I want ceviche I want small pieces of fish, not 4 huge ugly slabs. It was sloppy and uninspired imo.  On the flip side, we really loved the beef empanadas. They aren't traditional, but wow the puff pastry dough is good. The mac and cheese is great as are the sliders. The flat breads and shrimp are both great and hearty portions to boot. I think our favorite was the short rib. A pretty damn big slab for $12 and covered in the most delicious sauce.   If you're a Firefly regular - give it a try. It's more sophisticated and the drinks are way better!

We sat out on the patio to enjoy the nice night and because they only allowed happy hour specials at the bar/patio.  However, we would rather sit out there because it was just too dark in the dining area.  These are the tapas we ordered: -Mac and cheese with the habenero:  We all liked this very much that we  doubled the initial quantity.  The habenero gave this tapa a lil kick and was a wonderful compliment.  -Beef empanadas-this was everyone's favorite.  Was light and fluffy with ground beef and other spices in the middle...yum  -Chicken empanada-not as good as the beef empanadas, but is aight.  -Spicy tuna ceviche-one of us doesn't eat sushi/sashimi, but she thought this was delicious.  I honestly thought it was a bit too fishy while everyone else liked it.  -Hamachi tiradito-the citrus brought out the flavor of this fish.  Was light and refreshing.  Was one of everyone's favorite.  -Cuban Sliders-ham on top of pork, was kinda boring to me.  I like cuban sandwiches when there is a dipping sauce.  This one doesn't come with a dipping sauce.  -Crispy Shrimp-one said that this reminds her of honey walnut shrimp, I didn't care too much for it.  The shrimps were tiny.  -Beef taco-Better than the fish, not as good as the chicken taco.  The portion seem to be tiny for the amount of pickled cabbage given.  -Chicken taco-Taste the best out of the three kinds of taco.  The pickled purple cabbage and a slice of jalapeno tasted very good with this chicken taco.  -Fish taco-least favorite...the fish was BORING.  Didn't taste like much.  -Churros-Everyone loved this desert.  It was so soft and fluffy, with a nice vanilla sauce (I think) drizzled on top of it.  Not a typical churro that one would get at El Pollo Loco, which I like too btw.  Sopapillas-Eh.  Whatevers.  A rectangular baked dough on a dish of honey and powdered sugar.    Sugarcane sangria-This was GOOD.  Even for non-drinkers as myself.  Was very fruity with fruit pulp.    Blackberry mojito-Was on the tart side.  No one liked this pitcher very much...

I don't think you'll find better service anywhere in Vegas, really. I have been going to Firefly for years and have never left feeling like the employees knew me or cared about my return. It's the opposite at Cana.  I can't wait to go here when the weather gets nice too--large windows open up to the bar--it's a great indoor/outdoor space.

Most dishes hover right above $10, and the portions certainly do not match what you're paying for.  Last night was my third visit here, and each time I've been sure to stop by during happy hour.  Happy hour is from 5pm-7pm daily and gets you the following items at discount price (discount prices are listed below, and are approx. ~50% off full price, plus or minus $1):  Beef Empanadas, $6.00 - It's alright.  Ground beef with some veggies inside pastry bread.  I'll eat it but it's not my first choice.  Comes with two empanadas, each cut in half. Mac & Cheese, $4.00 - This is some tasty mac & cheese, using white cheese, cheddar cheese and some habanero.  The kick from the habanero makes this something that I would order every visit.  Portion is good for two, maybe three less-hungry people. Cuban Sliders, $6.00 - These are delicious little burgers!  Made with ground pork, with a little ham thrown on top just because.  They've been juicy and full of flavor every time I've ordered these (which happens to be every time I've been here).  Order comes with three sliders, which are small to begin with.  Not worth full price. Crispy Shrimp, $6.00 - Yes, it is pieces of shrimp.  Yes, it was probably crunchy at some time with some sort of breading.  But no, it is not crispy when it arrives.  Last night was the first time I ordered it, and the sauce it comes with (panko?) made the shrimp soggy.  It had a citrus flavor and wasn't bad, but I can't see myself ordering it again.  Portion was decent enough for two to share. Chicken Skewers, $? - The fifth and final food item on the happy hour menu.  The menu is small to begin with, and only five items are offered with happy hour pricing!  I *think* I had this during a previous visit but I'm not sure.  I didn't order it last night. Sangria, $5.00 - I think there were a couple varieties offered during happy hour, each being $5.00.  It's not my favorite drink so I didn't order.  During my visits it seems that on average people are paying roughly $15-$20 per person depending on who gets drinks.  When I go to Firefly with a group it's usually about $20 per person and the food is tastier, with more generous portions.

So, when I saw this place in Town Square I had to check it out.  First of all, there are 2 entries for Caña on yelp. Both refer to the same place but one has the address wrong. The correct address is 6599 Las Vegas Blvd. I'm posting my review under both.  Now for the review... Caña is located in the spot vacated by Louis's Fish Camp and they did a great job of remodeling the space. Louis's had a small bar and the entry way was a little odd -- kinda felt like you were walking in through the back door to get into the restaurant because of the small door, walking by the bathrooms and getting a glimpse of the  behind the bar  area before getting to the dining area. With Caña, the doorway is larger and more inviting and the bar is pushed back, adjoining the patio areas. The interior of the place is much darker and intimate as well. The bathrooms are in the same location but are not as pronounced.  As for the food... ehh... it was ok but not great.  Not even  really good  either.  - Hamachi ceviche -- as other reviews have mentioned they are not traditional ceviches. They're more like sashimi slices laying on a streak of citrus sauce. Hardly enough citrus to 'cook' the hamachi. It didn't taste all that fresh and lacked flavor.  - Short ribs -- one large short rib in a deep pool of guava glaze. The meat was very tender but didn't have much depth in flavor. A few more spices would have given it some kick and made this a great dish, but the meat all on its own was a little dull.  - Piggy back dates -- It seems like every tapas/bocadillos place HAS to have bacon wrapped dates. I guess I should be glad that this place did, because it was the best dish of the night. Great textures (although the amount of goat cheese mousse was overkill) and great flavors.  - Beef empanadas -- the outside of the empanadas was flaky and a little crispy. The inside could have used more beef. Almost every bite was pastry with a hint of beef. The beef tasted pretty good, I just wanted more of it.  - Crispy shrimp -- decent flavor, not as crispy as I would have liked.  - Sangria -- while it did taste good, it wasn't strong enough and was too sweet. It wasn't what I was expecting.  We sat at the bar on a Saturday night and didn't have any trouble finding seats. The service was very good. Our bartender was on top of things and we didn't have to wait long for drinks or food even though he and the other bartenders were very busy (all those mojitos take a while to make). Our bill came out to about $88 including tip for two people... not bad. However, I doubt I'll be back for the food. Caña might be a cool/chill place for happy hour but there are better places around town for tapas. I'd give them 2.5 stars if I could, but 'm rounding up.", "Date": "2010-02-14", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jinie", "ReviewID": "zy54I9fpYDjHQLs-5AhqwA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Good dating place.

There is also a new Sangria on the menu which is so refreshing and not too sweet.  Made with a Malbec and citrus juices (and Bacardi O) it is going to be the perfect complement to a warm Vegas breeze, swaying palm trees and ceviche.    Speaking of ceviche we tried the Mushroom Ceviche.  I think it was made with Beech Mushrooms.  Those were new for me.  They were soaking in a citrus marinade that made raw mushrooms absolutely tasty.  We also had the Spicy Tuna Ceviche and the Mixto made with shrimp, scallops, and calamari (they have an 'choose 3' offer that we couldn't resist).  The 3 of those along with the Hamachi was almost enough for us.    But even before the ceviches were ordered I could smell the aroma of truffle coming from the table next to us (and NO I am not sick of truffles yet)...so what did we have to try? The new Truffle Chips.  Um, HELLO, I need a whole bag of those right now!  Thin crispy waffle cut potato chips with grated parmesan and truffle oil.

The watermelon gazpacho was pleasing, but the flavours weren't really intermingled well. One bite would be incredibly delicious, and the next sort of bland. I definitely wouldn't write it off though.  Our cocktails were the highlight; my father had Fire Water which was a really unique concoction that included Ctristal Aguardiente, a Columbian liquor. The Diablo Dulce was exactly that, spicy and sweet- and utterly satisfying. The Sugarcane sangria was really good, and really sweet; I asked our waitress and from her description of its ingredients, -maybe it should be called High Fructose Corn Syrup Sangria. Sierra Mist is the contributing sweetness : /  There was also an interesting selection of South American Beers!  Their Hamachi Tiradito was a winner, and entirely cooked as opposed to raw.

For $11, I expected some mega-chicken and assorted toppings, but there were maybe 9 little cubes of chicken and close to no mango that was promised on the menu. Not cool. The yucca frites were not too special, and the  crispy  $12 shrimp were not crispy at all. They were a bit soggy. Plus, most everything came to the table not hot. I hate not hot tapas.

Order was: Hamachi  Chicken Empanadas Beef Empanadas Chicken Skewers Piggy Back Dates Crispy Shrimp Fish Tacos Short Rib Tacos  The Empanadas and Piggy Back Dates were the best things out of the selections.  I would come back just for those.  Everything else was ok but I wasn't feeling the Short Rib.  Cool place to try if you're looking for something a little different from Yardhouse or Cadillac Ranch.", "Date": "2010-12-13", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Serrano", "ReviewID": "wC8tEaI6koMQ7-g3Uh2vzg", "Overall": "4", "Content": "A friend recommended this tapas spot and I absolutely enjoyed the apps we got except for one.   We ordered the meatballs, hamachi, beef tenderloin, calamari and they were all great. We also ordered the Cevichi mushrooms but that was the only fail out of the things we ordered cuz it was very citrusy and a bit sour so we had it sent back and the waitress recommended the spicy tuna and it was very good!  Met the General Manager and he hooked it up with their special dessert that evening which was with ice cream, fried bananas and chocolate and like some waffle haha, IT WAS AWESOME!  It was a bit pricey for the portions that came out but its a nice place to take a date out to and the atmosphere was really chill...   Over all I was pretty impressed myself... I would highly recommend this place as a date spot! :)", "Date": "2010-04-07", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "leza", "ReviewID": "mvAh3a3KJpKADj9eWVejUA", "Overall": "3", "Content": "First, it is dark and you can't tell if it is even still in business when we were walking up. They need some sort of sign of life out front. We went here on a week night thinking it was Happy Hour menu. There were 3 of us. We ordered a ton of food wanting to try it all. And thinking Happy hour pricing. The server was training someone. You could tell they had both been drinking already. There were 3 tables in the restaurant and it was freezing in there. I wore my winter coat through the whole meal and still my teeth were chattering. The dynamic duo weren't sure if the the Beef Tenderloin Tiradito was available. We ordered Ceviche, tuna, dates, sliders, and short ribs, plus the beef tenderloin which we did not know if it was coming or not until it arrived. Usually tapas comes a few things at a time. Here it took forever and then BAM, it was all on the table. I have to say everything was delicious. I refused to share the beef tenderloin. The Sangria was very good too. After we ate we couldn't take anything as it doesn't travel well. So, don't overorder. The check came and we were surprised at the amount. My daughter had just been there the week before and they had Happy hour pricing at the time we were there. We asked the waitress what was going on with the check. She gave a long winded story about new specials and hours for Christmas shoppers. And went on forever, about lunch specials. Finally, we think she said they had changed the Happy Hours and we had missed it by 5 minutes. I know, we should have asked. But it is also good customer service to say  sorry you just missed Happy Hour . Especially since it changed from the previous week. We would have ordered the same anyway. It's the point that of all the 1000's of places in Vegas, we went there for food and Happy Hour. I am undecided if I will return. The service is the lowest. But the food is really good. For sure it won't be until summer. I hate eating in a winter coat. Maybe by summer they will have better service and people watching?", "Date": "2011-01-10", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
