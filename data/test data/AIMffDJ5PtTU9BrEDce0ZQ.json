I bet you can guess I always order the AYCE BBQ. $17.99 which is a great deal for wood smoke BBQ. It comes with pork ribs, brisket, and link sausage. Even though this is what I always order I have tried almost everything on the menu and have enjoyed it all.    This go around there was no wait and we were seated right away. Our server got us our drinks and took our order and a few minutes later our BBQ was on the table.   To me and the GF this place has the best brisket in town. Great smoke flavor and a smoke ring you can see in the meat. I personally love BBQ that you can taste the smoke in. The ribs are always very  fall off the bone  tender. I like the link sausage... not a huge sausage fan but it is very good. The sauces are good but not the best.....kinda sweet. The sides that come with the AYCE are just ok except for the beans... for some reason I really like them... nothing special just hit the spot for me. The sesame crusted bread is always sooo soft and good.   All you can eat for $17.99..... that's an insane deal.....mmmmm....give it a try if you enjoy a nice smoked meat instead of a mediocre meat slathered in  great  sauce.", "Date": "2008-06-19", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Gabby", "ReviewID": "lXMD2z5R4DpB4VMelktfrw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "OMG i must say the bread is AMAZING... i know it sounds kinda weird lol, but i think that was my favorite part of the whole meal!

We were seated immediately on a weekday, as it wasn't too busy at the Red Rock.  After getting our beverages, bread and butter were soon to arrive.  It's a soft bread with a sesame crust that leaves a slight bitter taste in your mouth after each bite.    I didn't want to load up too heavy before the movie, so I chose the Brisket Stuffed Mushrooms ($8.99).  The Salt Lick describes them as   Portabellini mushrooms stuffed with our house smoked brisket, cheddar cheese and peppers.  Baked and basted with our world famous Bar-B-Que sauce.   They came with four generous mushrooms that can be easily shared with another.  Watch out for the jalapeno pepper that comes along with it, it's a creeper!  Pretty tasty stuff!  The BF initially wanted the All You Can Eat ($17.99), which includes  Heaping helpings of slow-smoked brisket of beef, link sausage and pork ribs, served with potato salad, coleslaw, Mama Robert's beans, bread and butter.   With less than an hour before our show, he went for the Combination Bar-B-Que Meats ($15.99),  Slow-smoked brisket, smoked link sausage, and tender, juicy slow-cooked ribs  instead.  The sausage was damn good, and that's what I call a link!  It came with two ribs which didn't seem to have a whole lot of meet on it.  The BF said it was pretty dry for his tastes.  And the brisket was just okay.  It came with about three slices or so.  The coleslaw was lack luster, and the potato salad was a bit interesting.  It doesn't look like your typical potato salad, you'd expect a savory finish from the looks of it.  And the beans were alright too.  (You can see the pics of our eating in the business profile!)  The BF expected pickles and onions right off the bat with his order and was disappointed when he had to make a special request for it.  (Definitely ask for it!  It's pickled onions with some tasty pickles, so don't miss out on it!)  Service was okay.  After our lunch was delivered, a minute or so went by and the waitress asked,  You all set?   And we said we were and I got the feeling that she wasn't coming around again.  We did have to ask for refills on the BF's soda when she came around with wet napkins.  She did ask if we made room for dessert, which was sad to say no to.  (They had peach or berry cobbler!)  Overall, my lunch was good...not particularly fabulous or anything.  The only sauces available on my table was Heinz ketchup and a Texas hot sauce, so not sure what other sauces I was missing out on.  They have a few big screen TVs showing the game on, and they automatically add 20% gratuity for parties of 8 or more.  At first, I was impressed that the busboy took the time to wipe down the chairs when he cleaned up each table, then I realized he was also wiping off whatever was on the table straight onto the floor.

Not the best BBQ I've ever had but I'd go here again. Especially at $17.99 for all you can eat. I only wish it was REALLY all you can eat.

The sausage was really good and the ribs weren't bad either but the brisket was a little on the dry side, so I had to drench it in their BBQ Sauce....which wasn't necessarily a bad thing because their sauce is actually pretty damn good.

Of all of the restaurants in the Red Rock, I think I loathe this one the most due to the pricey, lackluster food.  Our service was no better than the food, as the waitresses were slow to take our order and were barely attentive during the night.  Prices here were high, but that is expected with most casino establishments that aren't buffets or cafe diners.  For nearly $16, a combination of ribs + any meat can be had (I chose the sausage).  The problem is, it lacks flavor and is completely bland.  This goes the same for the other items we ordered, like the turkey fingers, and the Shrimp Diablo, a fancy appetizer with a lackluster kick.  Hey, at least the cornbread is free.  Looks are so deceiving.  This place is spacious and rather well decorated, the drinks are strong, and the food actually looked relatively decent.  I was fooled into thinking the Red Rock had struck a slight gold mine by offering a BBQ joint that many other competing casinos failed to have.  From the moment I noticed how empty was to the first bite of my sausage / chicken combo, I knew this place was a disaster.  Gordon Ramsey ought to come here and inspire the chefs to make this place a dynamite joint.  But as always, it's too late.  Salt Lick BBQ is closed.

Sure, we were happy that they had Shiner Bock on tap.  But, wait...  what?!  No brisket baked potato?  And you want what ....an extra $2 for a large baked potato?   Anyhow, on following trips, they've gotten chinsey with bbq sauce, cheese, chives, and sour cream... even the massive baked potato has gotten smaller (but, at least, it's a FREE side now.  I don't know if that makes up for it).  And, worst of all, one of my favorite side dish at the Red Rock Salt Lick, the mac and cheese isn't as good as it use to be.  I would still go back for the Super Bowl buffet fest.

My friend & I both ordered the all-you-can-eat bbq meal. The sausage reminded me of a simple rope kielbasa which you can find at any supermarket so I wasn't impressed there. The rib & brisket was much better however the bbq sauces was pretty weak. Both the regular and  spicy  sauces were lack luster. The sides were also blah: slaw was crunchy but needed either more sweeter or dressing, the beans didn't shine at all and the potato salad had just bbq sauce tossed on it.  Overall, the Salt Lick has decent ribs & brisket but the rest of the food could use some modifications.

I came for entertainment and food.  I did not choose Salt Lick as our first dining encounter in this city, but did not complain about the prospect of eating here.  Finding Salt Lick was fun and not very difficult, a breezy walk through the casino gave us a menu of potential eateries as well as a view of the slot machines offered at Red Rock.  The bread was the highlight of the meal.  It was moist (and dare I say, gooey?) and paired with Promise  butter.   Boost your heart health before you smother it in fat and BBQ sauce, of which they have two, a red and an orange variety.  I had the baby back rib and chicken combo, with my two sides being potato wedges and corn on the cob.  I tried to veer on the healthier side and stayed away from the mac 'n cheese, but looking back on this I wish I had ordered that.  My ribs were not tender, did not fall off the bone, but did taste very good.  One piece of chicken was perfect and could easily be cut with my fork, the other piece was rough and I needed my knife to break up.  My sides were fine, nothing special, Chili's does corn better.  The service was awful.  Just awful.

I went with friends while checking out the Red Rock Casino in the Summerlin area of Vegas, and truly found a gem!  We were lucky enough to come during the Monday Night Football special from 7-9pm which featured ALL YOU CAN EAT BBQ for only $20!  You should've seen the look on our faces when we walked to the buffett table and found stacks of ribs, bbq chicken, beef brisket, sausages, chicken tenders, onion rings, potato salad, and fruit!!! I asked the waiter if I was in heaven, and he told me I was!  Wowzers, my stomach and taste buds orgasmed as I imagined all the possibilities of eating all that food!   Amazingly, the food turned out tasting better than it looked!  The ribs and chicken were my favorite, and the meat would just drip off the bones! The warm moist juciy bbq goodness topped with the tangy house bbq sauce and drizzled with spicy pepper sauce was to die for.  DROOL... I am getting hungry just thinking about it!!!    I seriously almost lost it while I was eating and much of my meal ended up on my face but I didn't care!    The wait staff was totally awesome too!  Funny thing happened when my Invisalign trays were accidentally thrown away because I keep them in a napkin when I eat!  You should've seen the look on my bbq covered face when I realized it was gone!  My friends couldn't contain themselves when they saw my face and busted up laughing, while I ran to the waitress and asked her to dig into the trash for my aligners...and she went and found them!  and she was nice about it too!    So i had to slip her a little sumthin-sumthin for her trouble.  $5!!!   All in all, please go eat here if you want to experience a gastrorgasm.  And don't forget to use the hot pepper sauce.

We felt snubbed, and I'm not sure why the wait staff acted the way the did, but there was no excuse for it.  We made that clear when we left our tip and I even left them a note.    Here's the deal:  I'm FROM the South. I've lived in Texas, Alabama, and Georgia. I know good BBQ when I taste it and this place was a not a place I want to remember.

The issue with here was definitely the seasoning...there were none. I'll always remember this experience last year, I ordered the ribs while my eating companion ordered the brisket...both tasted exactly alike. The sides had ZERO taste to them and the condiment BBQ sauce was extremely watery. I'll admit that I am a fan of Memphis BBQ styles, I did not expect Texas style to be so wildly different. The service also bothered me, we waited a total of 35 minutes to receive our check...not including our eating, prep, sides, and ordering times. I hope the owners learned well because this was a miss on many others' tastebuds.

I hate to say bad things about this place since the staff is so so so nice, but everything I ate seemed undercooked.   My serving of chicken was bleeding when I sliced it.  I asked the waitress if I could have another (cooked) piece and she said okay, but explained that it's supposed to be that way when it's smoked.  She brought another piece out and it was bloody inside as well.  I tried to take a bite to be a good sport, but I just couldn't eat that larval chicken.  I ended up getting an upset stomach for the next two days, but that might've just been a coincidence. I took a bite of my friend's ribs, and those seemed undercooked as well--or maybe my appetite was just ruined by then.   The Red Rock casino is really lovely though.

I removed the top of my sandwich because it was just too much bread (and for a carb addict like myself to say that is saying A LOT). It was okay,  but there were a lot of  really fatty looking chunks that just didn't seem appetizing.  The macaroni and cheese was pretty yummy though, but not very creamy.  Others in my group had BBQ chicken, brisket, and ribs.  It seemed to be the consensus that everything was just   okay.
