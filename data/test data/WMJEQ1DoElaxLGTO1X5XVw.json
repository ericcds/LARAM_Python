We shared an appetizer of coconut chicken skewers with a sweet chili sauce.  The plate was quite attractive with the skewers imbedded in a large pineapple segment.  I initially ordered a halibut dish, but was informed it was out of season.  I then followed Ms. wife's lead and ordered the crab crusted mahi mahi artfully arranged on top of lemon jasmine rice in a black bean buerre blanc sauce and accompanied by grilled asparagus spears.

They serve sushi at the sushi bar and regular dinner menu, and teppanyaki tables. The crowd is pretty much the hip and in crowd. Usually this place is packed at night. This is just one of those places the 3 times I've been here I saw someone I knew. So I'm half expecting it everytime. Apps are good, sushi reminds me of home.

I finally got to see what all the hype was about on my recent visit.  Celebrating a birthday with about fifteen guests monopolizing a huge rectangular table and barking out numerous requests for more food, drink, etc., I was definitely going to see how they would deal with us.    In terms of food, I tried a lobster roll, a Caterpillar roll, a deep-fried coconut chicken skewer in sweet chili sauce, and edamame.  The lobster roll was tasty, and the Caterpillar roll tasted as expected.  The chicken skewer came with four and the toasted coconut added a nice taste to it.  The edamame could have used more rock salt though.  Dessert - I went for the creme brulee, which was a big disappointment.  I had to listen to my fellow dining companions oohh and ahh over their much loved Banana's Foster.  I was very jealous.  Another companion raved about her cobbler.  She ate it all herself. Next time, go for the recommended Banana Foster's.  When almost everyone at your table is getting it (and they have been there before), follow suit!      The kitchen closes down around 11:30 pm, but the bar remains open.  This is a huge space with tons of tables.  I heard that their happy hour may be worth checking out.  If I'm in the area again, I wouldn't mind going through the menu a bit more extensively to see what else they got.  Linda, our waitress was great.  Dealing with a bunch of drunk and demanding patrons is never easy and she handled it with ease.  We like that.  Update! 02/26/07 - I was there last Friday night and can I tell you, this place is popping!  With their TWO happy hours, this is the place to be during those peak times!  You can drink yourself silly with sake bombs ($1.50 for sake; $4.75 for a large Sapporo or Kirin beer).  You can load up on sushi rolls (Spicy Salmon for $3.00) or their Kobe sliders ($7.00)!  Yeah, this place is huge, so keep your eye out on your waiter because they are super busy.  (They should just hire more staff.)  I had their Yellow Tang, this pineapply type drink that was super sweet and absent of alcohol, while their Mojito was overdone with it!  Either way, I have yet to sit down for a real dinner there but if you're there with friends for drink more so than eat, this is the place! FOUR STARS for their happy hour part!  Update! 09/21/07 - I should have read my own review before returning to Sapporo last night!  Taking advantage of their first happy hour again, the BF and I each ordered a mojito.  What a mistake!  They do really bad mojitos here!  I better remember never to order these things from here again.  From their happy hour menu, we ordered the Kobe Sliders ($7), the Crispy Calamari ($6), the Lobster Cocktail Roll ($6), and the Hamachi Roll ($6).  The sliders come in a group of four, and they are pretty tasty.  Four little sandwiches with caramelized onions and a dipping sauce, and the meat cooked (usually) to your liking, what a steal!  The calamari comes with a sweet dipping sauce, and a bed of lettuce leaves that we think are for decoration more so than consumption.  The lobster roll is pretty grub, mixed with a creamy (aka mayonnaise) sauce and avocado, I like it!  The hamachi roll is pretty standard with green onions mixed into it.   I realize that in all my visits to Sapporo, I have yet to go during non-happy hour times! Haha!   (If you're checking out their website, it looks like prices have gone up!  So be sure to double check your costs when ordering!)", "Date": "2006-09-12", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Lex", "ReviewID": "NEjPbirGZrF9zgZNmRrlcQ", "Overall": "2", "Content": "The sushi was great, and the service was BEYOND TERRIBLE.  They absolutely could not seem to grasp the facts that: 1) I have a soy allergy, and 2) I don't want wasabi in my nigiri sushi.  They screwed up my order so many times that I almost lost my appetite.  I ordered a la carte, but my meal consisted mainly of salmon sushi, even though I ordered a variety of things--they just kept sending me salmon over and over again!  It was crazy!  I went with 3 others.  One said her cooked food was bad.  The others were happy with their sushi, though I think their orders were a little screwed up as well (unfortunately, we were all too busy trying to keep them from giving me soy and wasabi to concentrate much on that).  Thankfully, I did not wind up in the ER, though I came amazingly close because they served me tamago (smelt egg)...Luckily, I thought to ask if it had soy in it, which it does.  This was well after I'd told them about my allergy, though.  I gave this restaurant  two stars because the fish was very fresh, and the sushi was excellent, though it would've been much better if I'd gotten what I had ordered as opposed to an all-salmon meal.", "Date": "2006-08-05", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jackie", "ReviewID": "LmSG0gJyfcXF7tWI6Dov9Q", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Pretty good, for being in the desert.

Our valet attendant recommended a local trendy hang-out on the outskirts---Sapporo on W. Flamingo Rd.  He said they have pretty good sushi and a huge bar.  So hubby and I hopped in our minivan and off we go.  Sapporo wasn't hard to find, it was freeway close and located in a shopping complex.  The restaurant is billed as a teppan yaki, Pacific Rim, sushi restaurant.  The hostess asked where we wanted to be seated, teppan side, sushi bar or main dining.  We opted for the sushi bar (of course).  As we entered the place I spotted the huge bar/lounge area that seemed to be the place of choice for the young, thin and looking-to-hook-up crowd (ah, those were the days I definitely DO NOT miss!).  There were three sushi chefs at the bar.  I was glad that it wasn't anymore crowded, I like to have the chef's full attention when I'm ordering.  We started off with our usuals: yellowtail nigiri, uni, sweet shrimp, blue tail toro roll (I was starving).  Then we tried the baby yellow tail nigiri.  OMG!!!!  That was soooo good.  Sooo sweet.  Then the kobe beef nigiri.  Hubby was hesitant to eat raw beef but went along.  My taste palates were orgasmic after having the kobe nigiri!!!!  I forgot the rest of what I've eaten after that one!  I wanted to order more but at $10 for 2 small slices of heaven...well, I was already getting full anyway.  The fish, uni, beef were all so fresh.  I didn't try any of the cooked entrees on the menu but hubby and I vowed that we would definitely go back on our next trip.  Everything on the menu looked interesting.  Our waiter was very cordial, helpful.  Sushi chef, well, he smiled once, and he did get our orders right.

I also know sushi.  Believe me.  So a  month or so back, while out in Vegas with some friends.. we decide that we're all getting a craving for sushi.  So where to go?  After a few years of coming to Vegas I had still to find that quintessential  it  sushi place.  So after a few searches online, we decide on Sapporo.  Holy Cow!  Where do I even begin?  The menu (which we looked at online before heading out) is a kalidescope of appetizers, entrees, deserts, sakes, beers, everything you could think of.  Some of us were craving Thai, some chinese, but all of us sushi, so it seemed like a perfect fit.  I called and made a reservation (even though it was just 3 of us, it was a Saturday night, after all).  Got there, got seated right away (it wasn't packed yet, but starting to get a little noisy, if anything, that was my only complaint, but given the decor and accoustics, I could see why the noise level would be that way).  Anyway, the food.  Oh.  OH wow.  We ordered an assortment of sushi rolls: Spicy tuna, spider, Avacdo, Philly... some other roll that I can't remember, and the Vegas Roll.  Whatever you do, when and if you go, you have to have the Vegas Roll, it's just a thing (trust me, eat it and you will understand).  Entrees (even though we barely had room left)... Kung Pao Beef = Excellent.  Pad Thai = Amazing.  Szechuan Beef = Awesome.  I can't think of anything bad to say about this place... Everything we ate was amazing (and leftover, the portions are huge... be warned).  What probably made this dinner even that much better, was after dinner, meeting up with some local friends at a bar, and everyone telling me how Sapporo is their favorite Sushi place in town.. seriously, EVERYONE raves about this place.  I will definitely be back there the next time around - interested in trying out their happy hour.
