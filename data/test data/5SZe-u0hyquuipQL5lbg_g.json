Their sushi rolls were actually the highlight and the price is unbeatable. We tried the sweet heart roll and the big eye roll. We also had the bacon wrapped scallops, cheese corn, Korean spicy ramen, tuna jalapeño poppers, and tempura green beans. The only thing I wouldn't recommend is the ramen. It's actually even advertised in a picture as a ramen packet and the noodles are obviously from a ramen packet. The jalapeño poppers could have used some cream cheese just because I think everyone is expecting it but very spicy and good. Everything we had plus sake was only $40 and we were stuffed (two people). Definitely beats all you can eat sushi. So glad there's an izakaya nearby and I hope it stays! Seems like they do a lot of takeout but it's definitely worth it to come in and experience it. They spread the timing of the plates out well and the waitress was very nice.", "Date": "2016-01-15", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Michael", "ReviewID": "O7Iz5eeslAUZ0QzZUJ34pA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Living in the Whitney Ranch area of Henderson, it's a pain getting into  Chinatown  for some more authentic Asian food. Fukumimi in SE Las Vegas is a godsend when the ramen bug bites (and it does quite frequently in our house), but any other Japanese cuisine, other than sushi, had us circling half of the valley on the 215 or 95 to get there, and with the a 2 year old, it's like driving with a time bomb. So when we noticed Yatai on our drive home from Fukumim a few weeks ago we got our hopes up.  I'm glad to say our expectations were exceeded.  Interior: larger than you expect when you walk up, very low key interior design but modern. Very clean.  Menu & Pricing: Large selection and the pricing is very good. We didn't see any specials, but the menu was large enough for us not to notice until we were talking the next day. Pricing was very good, most skewers ranged from $1.25 to $2.00, and other al-a-carte items were on par with other restaurants (i.e. karaage was $4.95). We ordered a grilled squid ($6.95 I believe) at the end of the meal that was big enough to be a meal for one person if you threw in a side of rice.  Food: Delicious. There were no 'rave' level items we ordered, but everything we did order will be ordered again. I did find the karaage on the bland side, but my wife, who's born and raised in Japan, told me that it's exactly the same way she would get at  izakaya in Tokyo and the other places in America serve it more the way mom's cook it at home.  Location: Make sure your car is locked.  Overall: Definitely will be heading back with a group of friends very soon.", "Date": "2014-12-08", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Antonio", "ReviewID": "TxKizfsXtN_qW38zXMO9mQ", "Overall": "1", "Content": "I wish I could select  zero stars but I'm forced to chose at least one...

We like that you order the same as some of the sushi places, where you just put the quantity you want for each item - be careful, though, as it can all add up quickly!

The staff were extra friendly and greeted us as soon as we came in, the tv playing a mixture of K-pop And SNSD singing in Japanese. We ordered a few yakitori parts such as hearts and livers, cow tongues. The menu was huge! So it might just take a little while to go through it all.

The location is a bit unusual simply because the east side is not really known for this type of food.  However, I can see that this location may appeal to the east side or even the Henderson residents.  This is definitely a positive for me!  Tucked in the back of the shopping mall, you can easily miss it if you don't slow down.  Upon arrival on a Saturday around 7:30 p.m., we were the only one there.  Not a problem to us - this means better service!   After being seated right away, our drink order was taken.  As a November special, $1 for a small hot sake or $2.50 for a large hot sake. What a deal!!!  The large hot sake was delicious.  We also ordered a pint size of the Sapporo on draft and some hot green tea.  (The green tea was from a tea bag and didn't taste like green tea at all.  Order the matcha if that may be an issue for you.)  Our server explained the menu and the ordering sheet and left us to decide while she gets the drinks.  We had the chicken hearts, chicken gizzards, chicken thigh meat, beef tongue, calamari rings, grilled squid, mixed vegetable tempura, and wasabi tako.  I think that was it.  There was absolutely nothing to complain about any of the food we ordered.  The grilled items were delicious; it was not too  char-y  or burnt like some places do it.  All the deep fried items were perfect; the oil was very obviously fresh.  The batter on the fried foods was perfect; not too chunky not too light.  And the wasabi tako was fresh as it should be.  Lastly, the grilled squid was very tasty because you can really tell the squid flavor (in a good way) and not burnt.  Some places grilled the squid so much at such a high temperature that it becomes burnt and dry - not here at Yatai!  And again, the service was fantastic.  Albeit we were the only table there, the server and chefs seem very eager to perform their jobs.  The chef actually came out and asked how everything was; I thought that was a nice touch.   We bought the $10 for $20 deal, so our bill came out to $53 plus the $10, so $63 before gratuity.  We had 3 hot sake and a couple beer and we reordered a couple of the grilled items, too.  So this is a very good price for this kind of service and quality of food.

The only reason why I gave 3 stars is that the food is not bad enough for 2 stars. We probably should have expected this experience when it was 8pm and 0 customers at this place.  We got the grilled yellowtail collar and it was undercooked and pink in the center. I told the server I wanted to cancel the order. She says hold on, goes to kitchen and asks, comes out to tell me ok and took the fish back. When the check comes out it still had the order on the check. We didn't say anything, left a generous tip and left. As for the other food it was mediocre at best for the price.   Edit: the owner apologized very sincerely about the fish and explained that it was my mistake about reading the receipt wrong. I have changed my rating to 4 stars because of his straight forwardness and I want to own up to my mistake.", "Date": "2015-01-12", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
