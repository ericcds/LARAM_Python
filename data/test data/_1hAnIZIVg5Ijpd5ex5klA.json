It is green and mild and I suggest eating it with Los Arcos (local Tortilla shop) chips because this is as close to homemade as you can get. I found both products at Whole Foods Fort Apache. This stuff is dangerous, half my bag of chips is gone and I am on my way out the door for a jog.", "Date": "2013-11-08", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Lisa", "ReviewID": "EuAmEonf928YtFDb2QWMDw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "I ran into Scott, the owner and salsa maker, upon entering Whole Foods in search of cranberry juice.  He was sampling fresh salsas he just made.  He sells them in Whole Foods, all local farmers markets, and a small store downtown.  He was sampling 5: pico, mild red, guacamolito (medium green), taco shop green (hot), and death salsa (red hot).  I tried the spicy ones.  The death wasn't spicy to me - but then again I am a native Texan - but my nose ran and my mouth salivated at the greens.  I do love a good green sauce and not often do I find one I like.  The guacamolito has a bright limey flavor (lime zest added!) and the taco shop green is just fresh and green with serranos and jalepenos plus cilantro.  I am a big fan and bought both greens.  Then I had to buy tortilla chips so I could eat it right away :)  I highly recommend picking up some True Foods salsa!", "Date": "2012-01-17", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Veronica", "ReviewID": "xevKuYd9XfufmtEAy9y2ww", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Awesome dude; awesome salsa. Came across Scott in his booth at the fresh52 farmers market in Henderson. I also remember having seen his salsa label in Whole Foods, and when I mentioned that, he told me he's always there under  local  and he's the only local salsa maker they stock (for now, anyway). Pretty cool! He had 5 salsas with him: pico, mild red, guacamolito (medium green salsa with avocado & lime), taco shop green (hot tomatillo), and death salsa (very spicy). They're all good, but I love his regular pico and the guacamolito the best, flavor-wise. Had to stop myself from buying more than one; I love eating salsa with chips, and I do not need to be eating any more chips than necessary. Holy yum, though.", "Date": "2012-11-12", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Christiana", "ReviewID": "0_ihsVj0jTeKOAxUYDeTsg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Found this SUPER DELISH and fresh salsa at the farmers market at Tivoli. I bought guacamolito. Which has a nice gentle heat and so much flavor! I should have bought more than one! It won't last long.   I could eat it with a spoon.", "Date": "2012-09-30", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
